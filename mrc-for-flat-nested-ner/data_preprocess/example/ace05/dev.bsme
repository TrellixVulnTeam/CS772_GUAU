to O
Moscow S-GPE

Khakamada S-PER

also O
need O
Russia S-GPE

help O
" O
to O
make O
the O
new O

seem O
legitimate O
. O
" O

Most O
analysts O
linked O
Russia S-GPE
's O
opposition O
to O
a O
war O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
to O
fears O
that O
it O
will O
lose O
oil O

that O
were O
sealed O
with O
the O
now-toppled O
regime O
of O
Saddam B-PER

The O
floodgates O
of O
Iraqi S-GPE
oil O
are O
also O
now O
likely O
to O
open O
to O
world O
markets O
and O
hurt O
Russia S-GPE

budget O
revenues O
-- O
which O
are O
heavily O
reliant O
on O
revenues O
from O
its O
own O
energy O
exports O
. O

But O
few O
at O
the O
Kremlin S-GPE
forum O
suggested O
that O
Putin S-PER

own O
standing O
among O
voters O
will O
be O
hurt O
by O
Russia S-GPE

apparent O
diplomacy O
failures O

Putin S-PER
will O
face O
re-election O
in O
March O
2004 O
and O
analysts O
noted O
that O
the O
war O
-- O
while O
opposed O

-- O
was O
never O
turned O
by O
the B-GPE

in O
modernizing O

She O

Although O
opposite O

of O
the B-LOC
Earth E-LOC
, O
Indonesia S-GPE
and O
Russia S-GPE
have O
some O
basic O
things O
in O
common O
. O

Both O
are O
geographically O
sprawling O
with O
massive O
multiethnic O
populations O
. O

Both O
are O
struggling O
to O
preserve O
national O
unity O
as O
they O
fight O
separatism O
and O
build O
democracy O
after O
the O
collapse O
of O
decades O
of O
authoritarian O
rule O
. O

Both O
are O
resource-rich O
, O
but O
face O
huge O
economic O
problems O
made O
worse O
by O

President M-PER
Putin E-PER
slated O
for O
April O
21 O
will O
touch O
on O
the O
Iraq S-GPE
crisis O

But O
other O

say O
that O

will O
serve O
primarily O
to O
bring O
the O
two O
closer O
together O
on O
bottom-line O
issues O
such O
as O
trade O
and O
arms O

Analysts O
worry O
that O
Indonesia S-GPE

now O
so O
degraded O
it O
can O
no O
longer O
control O
the O
borders O

Last O

And O
, O
broad O
opposition O
to O
the O
U.S.-led S-GPE

to O
lead O

`` O
Nearly O
everybody O
in O
Indonesia S-GPE
sees O
this O
Iraq S-GPE

as O
completely O
unnecessary O
and O
there O
is O
widespread O

Jakarta E-PER
. O

Close O
ties O
between O
Moscow S-GPE
and O
Jakarta S-GPE
are O
not O
unprecedented O
. O

Indonesia S-GPE
relied O
on O
Soviet S-GPE
military O
assistance O
in O
the O
1950s O
under O
Megawati S-PER
's O
father O
and O
founding B-PER
President M-PER
Sukarno E-PER
, O
but O
these O
were O
severed O
after O
the B-PER
anti-communist M-PER
Gen. M-PER
Suharto E-PER
seized O
power O
in O
1965 O
. O

The B-GPE
United M-GPE
States E-GPE
quickly O
became O
the O
Southeast B-GPE
Asian E-GPE
country O
's O
main O
weapons O
supplier O
, O
and O
annual O
arms O
sales O
peaked O
at O
US$ S-GPE
400 O
million O
in O
the O
1980s O
. O

In O
1991 O
, O
however O
, O
the O
U.S. S-GPE
Congress O
banned O
this O
after O
Indonesian S-GPE
troops O
killed O
hundreds O
of O
civilians O
in O
East B-GPE
Timor E-GPE
. O

In O
1999 O
, O
East B-GPE
Timor E-GPE
became O
free O
, O
but O
only O
after O
Indonesian S-GPE
forces O
laid O
waste O
to O
it O
as O
they O
withdrew O
after O
a O
pro-independence O
referendum O
. O

The O
shocking O
level O
of O
destruction O
prompted O
U.S. S-GPE
lawmakers O
to O
expand O
the O
ban O
to O
cover O
almost O
all O
military O
ties O
with O
Indonesia S-GPE

architect O
of O
the O
Iraq S-GPE

_ O
have O
pushed O
for O
the O
ban O
to O
be O
repealed O
. O

So O
far O
, O
U.S. S-GPE
lawmakers O
have O
reinstated O
only O
a O
limited O
officer O
training O
program O
. O

But O
that O
's O
far O
from O
enough O
for O
Indonesia S-GPE
's O
generals O
. O

`` O
I O
think O
the O
Indonesian S-GPE

has O
finally O
decided O
that O

conditionalities O
from O

just O
not O

Juwono B-PER

it O

And O
Colonel B-PER
Leonhard E-PER
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
talk O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
urban O
combat O
. O

And O
I O
wanted O
to O
just O
start O
this O
off O
by O
saying O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
when O
they O
hear O
about O
urban O
combat O
, O
they O
think O
of O
that O
Blackhawk O
down O
scenario O
, O
Mogadishu S-GPE
and O
the O
problems O
that O
can O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

This O
is O
not O
probably O
a O
comparable O
situation O
, O
is O
it O
? O

Not O
in O
any O
way O
. O

And O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
is O
because O
we O
have O
armored O
fighting O
vehicles O
there O
in O
Baghdad S-GPE
, O
and O
we O
will O
use O
them O
. O

Those O
tanks O
have O
120-millimeter O
smoothbore O
gun O
on O
them O
. O

The B-VEH
Bradleys E-VEH
have O
25-millimetre O
chain O
guns O
and O
coaxial O
machine O
guns O
. O

That O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
mobile O
protective O
gunfire O
. O

Completely O
different O
from O
the O
Mogadishu S-GPE
situation O
in O
which O
we O
did O
not O
have O
such O
vehicles O
. O

And O
we O
also O
are O
not O
going O
to O
use O
similar O
tactics O
there O
. O

We O
are O
much O
more O
likely O
to O
use O
patience O
and O
finesse O
rather O
than O
assault O
tactics O
. O

O'BRIEN S-PER
All O
right O
. O

We O
want O
to O
show O
you O
an O
animation O
, O
and O
share O
with O
our O
viewers O
, O
maybe O
you O
can O
point O
out O
a O
few O
things O
about O
this O
. O

If O
we O
move O
in O
on O
Baghdad S-GPE
, O
and O
give O
you O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
kinds O
of O
targets O
that O
might O
be O
encountered O
in O
urban O
combat O
. O

What O
we O
've O
depicted O
here O
is O
something O
here O
which O
shows O
some O
armor O
sort O
of O
off O
the O
wings O
here O
, O
right O
over O
here O
is O
a O
mosque O
. O

We O
depict O
that O
to O
show O
that O
's O
something O
you O
obviously O
want O
to O
stay O
clear O
as O
we O
just O
saw O
with O
the O
Ryan B-PER
Chilcote E-PER
piece O
from O
Najaf S-GPE
. O

As O
we O
get O
a O
little O
bit O
closer O
here O
, O
in O
a O
typical O
scenario O
like O
this O
, O
you O
might O
very O
well O
have O
Republican B-ORG
Guard E-ORG
snipers O
up O
on O
balconies O
like O
this O
, O
and O
possibly O
up O
on O
the O
roofs O
of O
buildings O
and O
anti-aircraft O
artillery O
or O
artillery O
encampments O
like O
that O
. O

What O
we O
have O
presented O
her O
is O
an O
armored O
column O
with O
air O
support O
coming O
in O
. O

How O
much O
jeopardy O
is O
a O
column O
like O
this O
in O
as O
it O
goes O
through O
these O
concrete O
canyons O
in O
a O
city O
? O

LEONHARD S-PER
It O
's O
a O
great O
question O
. O

I O
think O
the O
animation O
is O
good O
because O
it O
does O
show O
that O
you O
can O
hide O
literally O
anywhere O
in O
a O
city O
environment O
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
movement O
through O
an O
urban O
area O
is O
very O
, O
very O
dangerous O
. O

It O
's O
the O
side O
that O
's O
moving O
that O
's O
going O
to O
take O
the O
casualties O
. O

That O
said O
, O
the O
armored O
fighting O
vehicles O
that O
you O
see O
there O
they O
look O
to O
me O
as O
if O
they O
're O
moving O
a O
little O
bit O
faster O
as O
than O
we O
probably O
will O
. O

We O
'll O
use O
patience O
and O
finesse O
. O

We O
will O
take O
the O
time O
to O
locate O
the O
enemy O
, O
surround O
the O
blocks O
and O
the O
buildings O
that O
he O
is O
in O
. O

And O
then O
we O
'll O
probably O
surge O
fires O
into O
their O
both O
lethal O
and O
nonlethal O
to O
make O
his O
position O
untenable O
, O
to O
make O
him O
move O
rather O
than O
us O
moving O
through O
the O
assault O
zone O
. O

At O
which O
time O
we O
can O
engage O
them O
or O
arrest O
them O
. O

O'BRIEN S-PER
We O
'd O
like O
to O
resume O
with O
that O
animation O
if O
we O
could O
. O

That O
's O
Saddam B-FAC
International M-FAC
Airport E-FAC
. O

That O
's O
another O
segment O
. O

Can O
we O
get O
back O
to O
the O
animation O
. O

And O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
just O
finish O
this O
out O
. O

Here O
we O
go O
. O

Ad O
we O
move O
it O
along O
, O
you O
'll O
see O
eventually O
the O
troops O
will O
come O
marching O
in O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
slightly O
off O
target O
here O
because O
you O
see O
them O
all O
going O
in O
the O
front O
door O
. O

Typically O
, O
when O
they O
'd O
assault O
a O
target O
like O
this O
, O
they O
'd O
do O
what O
? O

LEONHARD S-PER
Well O
, O
typically O
, O
if O
they O
do O
go O
in O
, O
which O
is O
generally O
the O
option O
of O
last O
resort O
, O
but O
if O
we O
do O
have O
to O
go O
in O
, O
often O
we O
'll O
try O
to O
go O
in O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
building O
down O
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
is O
because O
we O
use O
grenades O
a O
lot O
in O
clearing O
buildings O
, O
and O
grenades O
ten O
to O
offend O
downhill O
rather O
than O
uphill O
. O

So O
, O
you O
always O
want O
them O
going O
down O
staircases O
rather O
than O
having O
to O
try O
to O
throw O
them O
up O
the O
staircase O
. O

O'BRIEN S-PER

What O
are O

here O

MCCANN S-PER
Just O
there O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
just O
getting O
the O
door O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
you O
can O
see O
where O
the O
weapons O
have O
to O
go O
. O

Now O
, O
you O
just O
see O
this O

right O
here O
, O
he O
's O
going O
to O
his O

to O
make O
a O
little O

And O
he O

to O
be O

Now O
, O
he O
's O
going O

, O

and O

you O
make O

, O

there O
are O
two O

one O
, O
of O

in O

here O
, O
which O
you O

n't O

, O
the O
other O
in O
this O
direction O
right O
here O
, O
and O
that O
's O
always O
the O

, O
because O
as O
you O
come O
in O

, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
be O
able O
to O

there O
quickly O
and O
make O

that O
this O

So O
... O
O'BRIEN S-PER

right O

Now O
, O
what O
about O
this O
, O
this O

this O

there O

No O

Also O
that O

right O

someones O

say O
, O
Well O

why O

O'BRIEN S-PER

Let O

if O

His O

left O

How O

do O
you O
anticipate O
large O

of O
U.S. S-GPE

will O
remain O
there O
? O

LUGAR S-PER
Well O
, O
I O
was O
heartened O
by O
what O
Secretary B-PER
Rumsfeld E-PER
told O
you O
in O
the O
last O
interview O
, O
that O
we O
will O
have O
troops O
there O
as O
long O
as O
necessary O
, O
but O
no O
longer O
than O
necessary O
. O

I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
pretty O
good O
way O
to O
state O
it O
. O

My O
own O
view O
is O
that O
the O
security O
of O
the O
country O
clearly O
is O
our O
responsibility O
presently O
. O

We O
are O
trying O
to O
pass O
that O
on O
to O
others O
. O

Likewise O
, O
the O
other O
government O
's O
procedures O
, O
the O
fledgling O
beginnings O
on O
democracy O
, O
and O
all O
the O
rest O
. O

But O
that O
's O
going O
to O
require O
an O
undergirding O
. O

Now O
, O
in O
due O
course O
, O
as O
everybody O
points O
out O
, O
we O
may O
get O
help O
from O
other O
countries O
. O

We O
may O
bring O
in O
NATO S-ORG
allies O
or O
the B-ORG
United M-ORG
Nations E-ORG
or O
other O
people O
in O
the O
Arab O
world O
. O

That O
would O
be O
helpful O
. O

But O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
this O
is O
our O
responsibility O
. O

And O
we O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
having O
large O
debates O
about O
how O
rapidly O
we O
move O
out O
. O

And O
I O
was O
upset O
, O
in O
a O
way O
, O
to O
hear O
reports O
that O
by O
the O
fall O
, O
three O
divisions O
out O
of O
five O
would O
be O
gone O
. O

I O
think O
Secretary B-PER
Rumsfeld E-PER
disabused O
us O
of O
that O
today O
. O

BLITZER S-PER
And O
what O
about O
you O
, O
Senator B-PER
Dodd E-PER
, O
not O
only O
the O
length O
of O
time O
, O
but O
the O
cost O
to O
U.S. S-GPE
taxpayers O
? O

Have O
you O
been O
given O
any O
ballpark O
estimate O
what O
this O
is O
going O
to O
cost O
the B-GPE
United M-GPE
States E-GPE
? O

DODD S-PER
No O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
we O
've O
heard O
the O
numbers O
of O
reconstruction O
running O
around O
$ O
100 O
billion O
. O

We O
put O
$ O
2.5 O
billion O
in O
, O
in O
the O
last O
supplemental O
appropriations O
bill O
. O

So O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
costly O
. O

These O
RFPs O
, O
these O
seeking O
bids O
on O
various O
contracts O
are O
rather O
costly O
, O
and O
so O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
expensive O
. O

And O
clearly O
the O
responsibility O
is O
going O
to O
fall O
principally O
on O
the B-GPE
United M-GPE
States E-GPE
. O

Now O
, O
I O
would O
hope O
that O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O
we O
could O
see O
a O
civilian O
government O
emerge O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
, O
a O
democratically O
elected O
one O
, O
that O
there O
'd O
be O
more O
cooperation O
from O
the O
international O
community O
, O
on O
both O
the O
peacekeeping O
side O
as O
well O
as O
the O
political O
restructuring O
that O
's O
necessary O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
. O

And O
to O
the O
extent O
we O
can O
move O
that O
along O
more O
quickly O
, O
I O
think O
we O
're O
all O
going O
to O
be O
better O
off O
. O

Being O
the O
sole O
, O
or O
almost O
the O
sole O
power O
there O
, O
both O
in O
terms O
of O
reconstruction O
and O
politically O
, O
exposes O
us O
to O
great O
vulnerabilities O
. O

BLITZER B-PER

we O

a O

I O
wanted O
to O

the O
U.N. S-ORG
role O
-- O
you O
say O
there O
could O
be O

Do O
you O
specifically O
want O
the B-ORG
United M-ORG
Nations E-ORG
to O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
peacekeeping O
role O
there O
? O

And O
secondarily O
, O
what O
about O
countries O
like O
France S-GPE

, O
and O
Russia S-GPE
, O
which O
opposed O
the O

do O
you O
want O
them O
shut O
out O

LUGAR S-PER
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
anybody O
shut O

I O
do O
hope O
the B-ORG

will O
play O
a O
vital O
role O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
, O
whether O
it O
be O
in O
peacekeeping O
or O
various O
other O
ways O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
that O
will O
occur O
soon O
. O

I O
think O
we O
really O
need O
an O
internationalization O
of O
the O
process O
, O
for O
the O
very O
reasons O
that O
Senator B-PER

pointed O
out O
. O

right O

We O
're O

and O
40 O
years O
imprisonment O
for O

murders O
in O
terrorist O
attacks O
against O
Israeli S-GPE

. O

Barghouti S-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
major O
leaders O
of O
the O
First O
Intifada O
in O
1987 O
, O
leading O
Palestinians O
in O
a O
mass O
uprising O
against O
Israeli S-GPE
occupation O
of O
the B-LOC
West M-LOC
Bank E-LOC
. O

During O
the O
uprising O
, O
he O
was O
arrested O
by O
Israel S-GPE
and O
deported O
to O
Jordan S-GPE
, O
where O
he O
stayed O
for O
seven O
years O
until O
he O
was O
permitted O
to O
return O
under O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
Oslo S-GPE
Accords O
in O
1994 O
. O

In O
1996 O
, O
he O
was O
elected O
to O
the B-ORG
Palestinian M-ORG
Legislative M-ORG
Council E-ORG
, O
in O
which O
he O
advocated O
peace O
with O
Israel S-GPE
, O
sometimes O
coming O
in O
conflict O
with O
Yasser B-PER
Arafat E-PER
. O

The O
formal O
position O
occupied O
by O
Barghouti S-PER
was O
the O
General O
Secretary O
of O
Fatah S-ORG
in O
the B-LOC
West M-LOC
Bank E-LOC
. O

By O
the O
summer O
of O
2000 O
, O
Barghouti S-PER
and O
Arafat S-PER
had O
grown O
increasingly O
at O
odds O
with O
each O
other O
, O
with O
Barghouti S-PER
accusing O
Arafat S-PER
's O
administration O
of O
corruption O
and O
his O
security O
services O
of O
human O
rights O
violations O
, O
and O
Arafat S-PER
was O
planning O
to O
fire O
him O
shortly O
. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
Second O
Intifada O
began O
, O
Barghouti S-PER
became O
increasingly O
popular O
as O
a O
leader O
of O
the B-ORG
Fatah M-ORG
Tanzim M-ORG
militia E-ORG
. O

This O
was O
perhaps O
due O
to O
the O
transformation O
of O
Tanzim S-ORG
into O
an O
organization O
more O
resembling O
militant O
groups O
like O
Hamas S-ORG
and O
Islamic B-ORG
Jihad E-ORG
, O
responsible O
for O
dozens O
of O
civilian O
deaths O
in O
drive-by O
shootings O
. O

Under O
Barghouti S-PER
, O
the B-ORG
Tanzim E-ORG
has O
also O
carried O
out O
suicide O
bombings O
in O
Israel S-GPE
under O
the O
name O
al-Aqsa B-ORG

' M-ORG

What O
is O

thinking O
? O

Release O
a O

to O
run O
the B-ORG
PLO E-ORG
and O
that O

bring O

peace O

a O
stronghold O
in O
poor O

, O
with O
the O

Mischie S-PER

They O
combined O

using O
their O
right O
of O
decision O
regarding O
the O
public O
funds O
for O
local O
leaders O
opposing O
PSD S-ORG
, O
and O
strong O
seduction O
of O
the O
uneducated O
masses O
, O
in O
a O
marvelous O
way O
. O

E.g. O
, O
Mischie S-PER
, O
who O
talks O
like O
an O
idiot O
, O
got O
a O
PhD O
in O
history O
. O

His O
paper O
was O
on O
a O
political O
personality O
of O
the O
19th O
century O
and O
Mischie S-PER
bought O
the O
house O
where O
his O
paper O
's O
subject O
lived O
. O

Maybe O
he O
tried O
to O
invest O
in O
his O
paper O
, O
maybe O
he O
believed O
sincerely O
in O
his O
admiration O
for O
the O
poor O
innocent O
dead O

and O
his O
ability O
of O
earning O
PhDs O
, O
but O
using O
a O
big O

are O
signs O
for O
the O
masses O
that O
the O
man O
is O
an O
invaluable O
and O
irreplaceable O

. O

Another O
misleading O
sign O
was O
his O
position O
as O
a O
University O
professor O
- O
he O
was O
teaching O
mostly O
at O
private O

, O
which O
are O
still O

All O
the O

the O
untold O
truth O
that O
Romanian S-GPE

seem O
to O
hide O
or O
not O
conceive O
yet O
. O

Mischie S-PER
was O
right O
to O
criticize O
the O
national O
leaders O
, O
because O
PSD S-ORG
got O
a O
good O
share O
in O
the O
elections O
in O
his O
area O
. O

But O
Mischie S-PER
was O
wrong O
, O
because O
he O
did O
that O
while O

Switzerland S-GPE
, O
where O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
if O
you O

. O

The O
new O
power O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
, O
but O
let O
the O
policemen O
do O
what O
they O
should O
be O
doing O
years O

. O

Iliescu S-PER

Nastase S-PER

If O

that O
the O

-- O
that O

have O
cost O

does O

match O
the O

they O
manipulated O

that O
the O

Good O

pretty O
high O

as O
the O
states O
are O

What O
's O
notable O
in O
this O
debate O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
according O
to O
MSN B-ORG
Moneycentral E-ORG
, O
tobacco O
executives O
are O
attacking O
the O
tax O
by O
noting O
that O
" O
While O
North B-GPE

is O
only O
5 O
cents O
, O
the O
total O

by O
smokers O
adds O
up O
to O
more O
than O
61 O
cents O

" O

Okay O
, O
okay O
-- O
since O
the O
tobacco O
companies O
pay O
lots O
of O
money O
to O
the O
states O
, O
that O
's O
technically O
accurate O
. O

But O
the O
point O
of O
these O
taxes O
is O
to O
align O
the O
price O
of O
a O
pack O
with O
the O
cost O
to O
society O
, O
and O
inasmuch O
as O
these O
penalties O
are O

assessed O
on O
a O

basis O
, O
they O
do O

-- O
they O
're O
a O
lump-sum O
reflection O
of O
the O
taxes O
these O
companies O
ought O
to O

paid O
before O

Interestingly O
, O
the O
policy O
of O
making O
cigarette O
buyers O
pay O
to O
compensate O
society O
for O
the O
costs O
they O
impose O
is O
a O
politically O
palatable O
synthesis O
of O
the O
unpalatable O
notion O
of O
simply O
refusing O

a O

day O
for O
the O
Seattle S-GPE
scene O
. O

Amazon S-ORG
ended O
the O
day O
down O
14.6 O
% O
. O

Starbucks S-ORG
down O
8.2 O
% O
. O

I O
should O
disclose O
that O
I O
spent O
a O
few O
years O
living O
in O
Seattle S-GPE
and O
I O
have O
a O
soft O
spot O
in O
my O
heart O
for O
all O
things O
Seattle S-GPE
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
could O
tell O
, O
many O
people O
in O
the O
Northwest O
spend O
the O
mornings O
drinking O
lattes O
and O
their O
evenings O
drinking O
microbrews O
. O

Really O
not O
a O
bad O
lifestyle O
. O

Anyway O
, O
back O
on O
topic O
here O
. O

Market O
over O
reaction O
? O

Hard O
to O
say O
. O

Both O
companies O
have O
pricey O
stocks O
and O
those O
valuations O
are O
based O
on O
optimistic O
expectations O
of O
future O
growth O
. O

Yesterday O
's O
news O
led O
many O
to O
question O
their O
growth O
assumptions O
for O
these O
companies O
. O

Today O
I O
want O
to O
talk O
a O
bit O
about O
Starbucks S-ORG
. O

I O
think O
I O
have O
to O
start O
by O
acknowledging O
that O
the O
stock O
is O
still O
pricey O
even O
after O
its O
drop O
yesterday O
. O

However O
, O
my O
organizational O
indicators O
analysis O
reveals O
a O
very O
low O
level O
of O
business O
risk O
. O

This O
may O
partially O
justify O
a O
higher O
P/E O
ratio O
. O

A O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I O
observed O
that O
Wal-Mart S-ORG
had O
offsetting O
strong O
and O
weak O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Starbucks S-ORG
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
has O
uniformly O
strong O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Starbucks S-ORG
scores O
as O
best O
in O
its O
industry O
on O
six O
of O
seven O
organizational O
indicators O
. O

Not O
surprising O
are O
its O
strong O
scores O
in O
the O
employee O
relations O
and O
stakeholder O
actions O
indicators O
. O

Its O
weakest O
score O
is O
in O
the O
external O
reporting O
indicator O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
several O
observers O
have O
raised O
concerns O
about O
aggressive O
accounting O
at O
Starbucks S-ORG
but O
my O
analysis O
does O
not O
indicate O
any O
systematic O
current O
issues O
. O

The O
weak O
score O
is O
primarily O
the O
result O
of O
Starbucks S-ORG
current O
strategy O
of O
increasing O
equity O
ownership O
of O
several O
foreign O
subsidiaries O
. O

This O
is O
a O
strategic O
shift O
that O
has O
short-term O
costs O
and O
adds O
some O
uncertainty O
to O
the O
financial O
statements O
. O

Beyond O
the O
strong O
Organizational O
Indicator O
analysis O
, O
several O
additional O
factors O
favor O
Starbucks S-ORG
ability O
to O
continue O
to O
grow O
revenues O
. O

1 O
. O

Starbucks S-ORG
has O
little O
debt O
. O

Starbucks S-ORG
is O
not O
currently O
financing O
its O
growth O
with O
debt O
. O

Considering O
its O
growth O
, O
this O
is O
amazing O
. O

It O
also O
means O
that O
Starbucks S-ORG
has O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
flexibility O
in O
how O
it O
finances O
future O
growth O
. O

The O
company O
can O
assume O
much O
more O
debt O
without O
negatively O
affecting O
its O
risk O
profile O
because O
... O
2 O
. O

Starbucks S-ORG
has O
a O
healthy O
cashflow O
and O
current O
cash O
position O
. O

This O
allows O
the O
company O
to O
grow O
without O
debt O
. O

You O
could O
argue O
that O
Starbucks S-ORG
has O
too O
much O
cash O
and O
should O
do O
more O
to O
pass O
it O
on O
to O
shareholders O
. O

This O
option O
is O
another O
way O
that O
Starbucks S-ORG
has O
retained O
its O
flexibility O
for O
the O
future O
. O

3 O
. O

Starbucks S-ORG
is O
the O
primary O
owner O
of O
its O
stores O
and O
limits O
franchising O
. O

While O
Starbucks S-ORG
does O
partner O
( O
airlines O
, O
airports O
, O
Barnes B-ORG
&amp; M-ORG
Noble E-ORG
) O
, O
most O
of O
its O
stores O
are O
company O
owned O
. O

From O
a O
managerial O
perspective O
this O
greatly O
simplifies O
cost O
structures O
, O
product O
changes O
, O
and O
quality O
control O
. O

Taken O
together O
all O
of O
these O
factors O
paint O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
company O
with O
a O
very O
strong O
future O
. O

I O
can O
not O
say O
if O
these O
factors O
justify O
the O
current O
share O
price O
but O
I O
would O
say O
that O
they O
justify O
a O
higher O
P/E O
ratio O
than O
the O
industry O
norm O
. O

Risk O
is O
lower O
. O

Interesting O
aside O
: O
Starbucks S-ORG
is O
taking O
over O
the O
location O
in O
my O

that O

tell O
her O
it O
'll O
just O
take O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
. O

We O
'll O
see O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
making O
the O
kind O
of O
salary O
I O
was O
hoping O
to O
get O
, O
but O
it O
's O
the O
best O
salary O
I O
've O
gotten O
thus O
far O
. O

When O
I O
was O
fulltime O
in O
radio O
I O
made O
a O
little O
less O
, O
but O
I O
got O
quite O
a O
few O
remotes O
, O
which O
make O
up O
for O
not O
getting O
a O
topnotch O
salary O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
doing O
my O
TV O
announcing O
and O
my O
weekend O
radio O
stuff O
, O
so O
that O
money O
will O
help O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
start O
actively O
pursuing O
more O
voice O
work O
in O
the O
next O
month O
or O
so O
, O
too O
. O

My O
plan O
is O
to O
pay O
off O
my O
car O
early O
, O
and O
then O
work O
on O
the O
other O
debts O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
time O
to O
go O
on O
and O
fill O
out O
the O
adoption O
applications O
. O

I O
'm O
terrified O
of O
more O
debt O
, O
but O
Mom S-PER
and O
Dad S-PER
will O
help O
with O
the O
money O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
they O
realize O
how O
expensive O
it O
all O
is O
. O

I O
'm O
thinking O
we O
might O
lean O
toward O
adopting O
from O
Guatemala S-GPE
, O
but O
we O
've O
still O
not O
hashed O
it O
all O
out O
. O

It O
's O
almost O
bad O
making O
some O
money O
now O
, O
because O
while O
most O
of O
me O
wants O
to O
save O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
the O
other O
, O
smaller O
part O
is O
screaming O
loudly O
for O
stuff O
, O
stuff O
, O
stuff O
!!! O

I O
've O
got O
a O
trial O
subscription O
to O
XM O
at O
work O
because O
of O
the O
Dell S-ORG
computers O
, O
and O
now O
I O
'm O
lusting O
to O
have O
it O
all O
of O
the O
time O
. O

G S-PER
got O
me O
a O
nice O
office O
stereo O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
it O
does O
have O
an O
aux O
jack O
, O
so O
I O
could O
listen O
to O
it O
here O
. O

He O
asked O
if O
I O
wanted O
a O
car O
stereo O
, O
and O
I O
said O
no O
, O
but O
I O
do O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things O
I O
want O
. O

A O
garage O
. O

A O
dining O
room O
set O
. O

New O
stuff O
for O
our O
house O
. O

New O
clothes O
. O

New O
everything O
. O

But O
I O
want O
family O
more O
. O

I O
think O
part O
of O
the O
draw O
of O
the O
other O
stuff O
is O
I O
could O
get O
it O
now O
. O

But O
I O
'd O
be O
paying O
for O
it O
later O
. O

Money O
makes O
the O
world O
go O
round O
and O
round O
and O
round O
til O
I O
'm O
just O
dizzy O
. O
