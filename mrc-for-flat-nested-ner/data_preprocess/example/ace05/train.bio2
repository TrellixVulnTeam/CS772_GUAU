is	O
what	O
do	O
you	O

what	O

there	O
's	O
no	O
proof	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

well	O

the	O
key	O
here	O
is	O

only	O
way	O

that	O
kind	O
of	O
legitimate	O
government	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
look	O
good	O
is	O
to	O
hold	O
elections	O
.	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
hold	O
elections	O
,	O
you	O
stop	O
the	O
whole	O

in	O

for	O
example	O
,	O
you	O
held	O
elections	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
ethnic	O
thugs	O
get	O
into	O
power	O
because	O
they	O
have	O

they	O

stop	O

RUMSFELD	B-PER

what	O

it	O
takes	O

It	O
also	O
takes	O
time	O

out	O
what	O

might	O
be	O
appropriate	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
Colin	B-PER
and	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
concerned	O
about	O
,	O
both	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
taking	O
so	O

There	O
are	O
a	O

of	O

and	O
the	B-ORG

has	O
the	O

would	O

RUMSFELD	B-PER

question	O

that	O
the	O
troops	O
,	O
the	O
young	O
men	O

women	O
,	O
did	O
such	O
a	O
superb	O

that	O
there	O
has	O

be	O
a	O

And	O

What	O
's	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
?	O

In	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
1991	O
,	O
the	O
task	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
in	O

get	O
them	O
out	O

were	O

In	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
n't	O
dwell	O
on	O
that	O
point	O
specifically	O
,	O
because	O
Saddam	B-PER

was	O

producer	O

a	O
user	O

He	O

was	O

or	O
at	O

BLITZER	B-PER

how	O

DODD	B-PER
Well	O

it	O
's	O
important	O

But	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
as	O
important	O
as	O
finding	O
Osama	B-PER
bin	I-PER

,	O
for	O
the	O
simple	O
reason	O
that	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
Saddam	B-PER
Hussein	I-PER
today	O
poses	O
any	O
threat	O
,	O
wherever	O
he	O
is	O

If	O
he	O
is	O
alive	O
,	O
obviously	O

he	O
does	O
n't	O
pose	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O

that	O
an	O
Osama	O

does	O
with	O

to	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
certainly	O
be	O
good	O
to	O

would	O

to	O

to	O
bring	O
him	O

But	O
I	O
do	O

think	O
it	O
's	O
absolutely	O
critical	O
for	O

It	O
describes	O
how	O
the	O
European	B-GPE
Governments	O
look	O
to	O
be	O
changing	O
their	O
tune	O
in	O
regards	O
to	O
President	B-PER
Bush	I-PER
.	O

Why	O
you	O
ask	O
?	O

But	O
there	O
is	O
arguably	O
more	O
to	O
this	O
sea	O
change	O
than	O
just	O
a	O
grumpy	O
acceptance	O
of	O
the	O
status	O
quo	O
.	O

From	O
a	O
European	B-GPE
perspective	O
,	O
three	O
things	O
are	O
making	O
it	O
easier	O
to	O
warm	O
to	O
the	B-ORG
Bush	I-ORG
White	I-ORG
House	I-ORG
.	O

One	O
is	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
Yasser	B-PER
Arafat	I-PER
.	O

No	O
issue	O
divides	O
Europe	B-GPE
and	O
the	B-GPE
United	I-GPE
States	I-GPE
more	O
keenly	O
than	O
the	O
Israeli-Palestinian	B-GPE
dispute	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
last	O
few	O
years	O
,	O
Europeans	O
have	O
criticized	O
Bush	B-PER
for	O
failing	O
to	O
put	O
enough	O
pressure	O
on	O
Israel	B-GPE
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
occupied	O
territories	O
and	O
for	O
refusing	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
Arafat	B-PER
.	O

That	O
another	O
reason	O
why	O
I	O
respect	O
Bush	B-PER
so	O
much	O
,	O
his	O
refusal	O
to	O
acknowledge	O
that	O
windbag	O
terrorist	O
Arafat	B-PER
.	O

May	O
he	O
rot	O
in	O
hell	O
.	O

But	O
since	O
Arafat	B-PER
's	O
death	O
,	O
Europeans	O
and	O
Americans	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
find	O
common	O
ground	O
:	O
supporting	O
Ariel	B-PER
Sharon	I-PER
's	O
withdrawal	O
from	O
Gaza	B-LOC
,	O
putting	O
pressure	O
on	O
Israel	B-GPE
to	O
let	O
the	O
Palestinians	O
hold	O
elections	O
and	O
,	O
covertly	O
,	O
backing	O
Mahmoud	B-PER
Abbas	I-PER
to	O
become	O
the	O
next	O
Palestinian	B-GPE
leader	O
.	O

A	O
second	O
reason	O
is	O
Europe	B-GPE
's	O
growing	O
worries	O
about	O
Islamic	O
terrorism	O
.	O

The	O
murder	O
in	O
November	O
of	O
Theo	B-PER
van	I-PER

,	O
a	O
provocative	O
Dutch	B-GPE
filmmaker	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
an	O
Islamic	O
militant	O
has	O
been	O
called	O
Europe	B-GPE
's	O
9/11	O
.	O

Though	O
the	O
two	O
events	O
are	O
obviously	O
not	O
fully	O
comparable	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
certainly	O
true	O
that	O
American	B-GPE
conservatives	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
Francis	B-PER
Fukuyama	I-PER
and	O
Bernard	B-PER
Lewis	I-PER
,	O
have	O
found	O
a	O
wider	O
audience	O
recently	O
for	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
radical	O
Islam	O
is	O
inimical	O
to	O
European	B-GPE
traditions	O
of	O
tolerance	O
.	O

You	O
mean	O
those	O
radical	O
muslims	O
can	O
be	O
kinda	O
nasty	O
sometimes	O
?	O

Get	O
outta	O
here	O
....	O
Keep	O
doing	O
business	O
like	O
the	O
cowards	O
in	O
Spain	B-GPE
and	O
they	O
will	O
more	O
then	O
likely	O
have	O
their	O
very	O
own	O
9/11	O
to	O
cry	O
about	O
.	O

The	O
third	O
force	O
is	O
the	O
reappearance	O
,	O
albeit	O
in	O
a	O
milder	O
form	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
threat	O

I	O

that	O
they	O

what	O
's	O
better	O
is	O
that	O
Auburn	B-ORG
gets	O
to	O
play	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
hottest	O
teams	O
in	O
the	O

in	O
my	O
opinion	O

Virginia	B-ORG

one	O

they	O
WILL	O

this	O

focus	O
on	O
making	O

You	O

after	O
Kobe	B-PER

He	O
bought	O
his	O

four	O

some	O

he	O

to	O
do	O
more	O
to	O
attract	O

he	O
told	O

this	O

Shaq	B-PER

denied	O
it	O
from	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
the	O

It	O
's	O
no	O

a	O

Kemp	B-PER

Bryant	B-PER

So	O
the	O
real	O

not	O

I	O
guess	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
as	O
straight	O
forward	O
when	O
your	O
CEO	O
is	O
also	O
chairman	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
tempting	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
my	O
high	O
horse	O
right	O
now	O
about	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
separate	O
the	O
positions	O
of	O
CEO	O
and	O
Chairman	O
but	O
to	O
be	O
honest	O
with	O
you	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
believe	O
that	O

I	O
know	O
CEO/chair	O
duality	O
is	O
a	O
popular	O
cause	O
for	O
corporate	O
governance	O
.	O

However	O
there	O
is	O
little	O
empirical	O
evidence	O
to	O
suggest	O
that	O
separating	O
these	O
roles	O
affects	O
firm	O
performance	O
in	O
either	O
a	O
positive	O
or	O
negative	O
way	O
.	O

Having	O
a	O
combined	O
CEO/Chairman	O
does	O
reduce	O
the	O
ability	O
of	O
the	O
board	O
to	O
act	O
as	O
a	O
check	O
on	O
management	O
and	O
this	O
does	O
mean	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
critical	O
in	O
your	O
assessment	O
of	O
the	O
trustworthiness	O
of	O
the	O
top	O
management	O

.	O

This	O
downside	O
of	O
having	O
a	O
combined	O
CEO/chair	O
is	O
offset	O
by	O
(	O

)	O
a	O
reduction	O
of	O

It	O
is	O
