had O

" O
She O
thanked O
us O
for O
our O

made O
sure O
we O
knew O
the O
people O

grateful O
for O
the O

by O
all O

" O
Janet B-PER

It O
was O
an O

that O
maybe O
we O

doing O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

I O
talked O
to O
a O
friend O
currently O
serving O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
last O
night O
and O
he O
says O
morale O
is O
up O
and O
the O
presence O
of O

is O
a O
positive O
thing O
. O

They O
just O
ca O

pack O
up O

We O

Not O
that O
I O
was O
surprised O
- O
considering O
not O
long O

we O
were O
introduced O
to O
a O
people O
who O
proudly O
donned O
the O
" O
I O
had O
an O
abortion O
" O
slogan O
with O
great O
pride O
on O
their O
t-shirts O
. O

The O
first O
trackback O
entry O
is O
from O
the O
typical O
anti-Christian O
variety O
: O
Ms. B-PER
Rytel E-PER
is O
absolutely O
correct O
, O
the O
anti-abortion O
Christians O
have O
managed O
to O
convice O
( O
sic O
) O
nearly O
everyone O
that O
abortion O
is O
wrong O
and O
people O
should O
feel O
horribly O
guilty O
over O
it O
. O

Like O
we O
have O
n't O
heard O
this O
rant O
before O
. O

Yes O
, O
only O
the O
Christians O
value O
life O
when O
it O
's O
a O
life O
before O
birth O
. O

Of O
course O
it O
would O
be O
wrong O
to O
make O
people O
feel O
" O
horribly O
guilty O
" O
over O
abortion O
, O
but O
celebrating O
the O
skull-cracking O
procedure O
" O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
child O
" O
in O
the O
form O
of O
t-shirts O
and O
jewelry O
is O
to O
be O
admired O
. O

The O
problem O
for O
the O
pro-abortion O
movement O
is O
that O
hardly O
anyone O
is O
taking O
a O
stand O
to O
reverse O
this O
societal O
brainwashing O
. O

Even O
by O
calling O
the O
movement O
" O
pro-choice O
" O
instead O
of O
" O
pro-abortion O
, O
" O
it O
gives O
credence O
to O
the O
Christian O
loonies O
. O

Here O
is O
where O
I O
agree O
with O
my O
fellow O
Libertarian O
. O

" O
Pro-choice O
" O
is O
a O
soft O
and O
weak O
label O
for O
what O
those O
people O
really O
truly O
represent O
. O

I O
prefer O
pro-murder O
, O
anti-life O
or O
anti-responsibility O
as O
a O
suitable O
replacement O

The O

criticism O
Monday O
from O
members O
of O
his B-ORG
own M-ORG
Likud M-ORG

over O
his O
Cabinet O
's O
acceptance O
of O
the O
U.S.-backed S-GPE
`` O

'' O
peace O

Sharon S-PER
indicated O
a O
180-degree O
turnaround O
after O
decades O
of O
warning O
that O
an O
Israeli S-GPE
withdrawal O
from O
even O
small O
parts O
of O
the B-LOC
West M-LOC
Bank E-LOC
could O
endanger O
Israel S-GPE

existence O
. O

Skeptics O
, O
however O
, O
wondered O
whether O
Sharon S-PER

conversion O
was O
a O
shrewd O
effort O
to O
deflect O
U.S. S-GPE
pressure O
in O
the O
hopes O
the O
road O

would O
fail O
before O
Israel S-GPE
had O
to O
make O
tough O
concessions O
. O

`` O
To O
keep O
3.5 O
million O
people O
under O

bad O
for O
us O
and O
them O
, O
'' O
Sharon S-PER
said O
in O
remarks O
broadcast O
on O
Israel B-ORG
Radio E-ORG
. O

The O
term O
`` O
occupation O
'' O
is O
anathema O
to O
the O
Israeli S-GPE
right O
, O
which O
believes O
Israel S-GPE
has O
a O

claim O
to O
the B-LOC

. O

Palestinians O
and O
their O
dovish O
Israeli S-GPE
allies O
routinely O
use O
the O
word O
`` O

'' O
when O
demanding O
that O
Israel S-GPE
leave O
the B-LOC
West M-LOC
Bank E-LOC
and O
Gaza S-LOC
and O
dismantle O
Jewish O
settlements O
. O

Palestinians O
claim O
all O
of O
the B-LOC
West M-LOC
Bank E-LOC
and O
Gaza S-LOC
for O
a O
state O
. O

On O
Sunday O
, O
Sharon S-PER

Cabinet O
conditionally O
approved O
the O
`` O
road O

'' O
a O
three-phase O
plan O
that O
begins O
with O
a O

in O
the B-LOC

said O
Sharon S-PER

long-held O
condition O
that O

share O
your O
frustration O
at O
the O
reaction O
to O

nod O
to O
Spottswood B-PER

Among O
some O
segments O

, O
it O
is O
indeed O
a O
matter O
of O
damned-if-you-do O

. O

But O
you O
could O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
of O
the B-ORG
Democratic M-ORG
Party M-ORG
as M-ORG
a M-ORG
whole E-ORG
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
African B-PER
Americans E-PER
, O
though O
still O
overwhelmingly O
Democratic O
, O
comprise O
less O
of O
a O
monolith O
than O
they O
did O
20-30 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
find O
myself O
continually O
amazed O
at O
how O
open-minded O
many O
young O
African-Americans O
are O
. O

And O
I O
think O
that O
open-mindedness O
goes O
a O
long O
way O
to O
explain O
the O
desperate O
efforts O
of O
many O
( O
not O
all O

many O
) O
within O
the B-ORG

to O
circle O

when O
the O

pointed O
out O
the O

Hand O
in O
hand O
with O
any O
consideration O
of O
the O
redistricting O
process O
, O
we O
shoul O
give O
some O
thought O
to O
the O
structural O
relationship O
between O
the B-ORG
state M-ORG
House M-ORG
and M-ORG
Senate E-ORG
. O

Currently O
, O
each O
House S-ORG
member O
represents O
approximately O
75,000 O
Virginians O
, O
while O
each O
Senator O
represents O
appoximately O
187,500 O
. O

Often O
as O
not O
, O
there O
is O
no O
rational O
commonality O
between O
the O
two O
. O

Some O
senators O
represent O
people O
pools O
that O
are O
in O
turn O
fractured O
into O
five O
or O
six O
House S-ORG
districts O
. O

I O
believe O
this O
accounts O
, O
in O
large O
part O
, O
for O
the O
dysfunction O
that O
characterizes O
our O
state O
government O
now O
. O

Former B-PER
Governor M-PER
Gerald M-PER
Baliles E-PER
, O
in O
this O
same O
vein O
, O
has O
advocated O
a O
realignment O
of O
the O
two O
houses O
in O
a O
way O
that O
serves O
commonalities O
. O

He O
has O
suggested O
that O
we O
either O
increase O
membership O
in O
the B-ORG
Senate E-ORG
to O
50 O
, O
or O
decrease O
House S-ORG
membership O
to O
80 O
, O
producing O
a O
scenario O
wherein O
1 O
Senator O
would O
represent O
a O
block O
of O
people O
who O
are O
represented O
by O
exactly O
2 O
Delegates O
. O

He O
thinks O
-- O
and O
I O
think O
he O
is O
right O
-- O
that O
this O
arrangement O
would O
foster O
a O
closer O
working O
relationship O
between O
the B-ORG
Senate E-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
House E-ORG
. O

You O
certainly O
would O
n't O
have O
these O
dysfunctional O
groupings O
we O
now O
have O
, O
where O
1 O
Senator O
often O
represents O
a O
population O
divided O
among O
half O
a O
dozen O
Delegates O
of O
two O
parties O
-- O
three O

One O
fellow O
, O
a O
Brazilian O
, O
has O
done O
everything O
by O

He O

They O

Of O

, O
the O
Americans O
who O
employ O
illegal O

are O
happy O
to O
pay O

it O

Who O

The O
illegal O

themselves O

of O

The O

them O
instead O
of O
raising O

native-born O

the O
announcement O
today O
that O
he O
would O

Why O
not O

Surely O
Chris B-PER

at O

more O
credible O
than O
Carol B-PER

I O

NOVAK B-PER
Congressman B-PER

, O
you O

I O
'm O
not O

it O
myself O

But O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
a O
question O

When O
the O

when O
the O
American S-GPE
men O

are O

the O

( O

SANDERS S-PER
Well O
it O

not O
-- O
are O
you O
suggesting O
that O
when O
tens O

thousands O
of O
Iraqi S-GPE
women O

killed O

when O

what O
should O

The O
answer O
is O
, O
these O
are O
my O
neighbors O
from O
Vermont S-GPE
and O
obviously O
we O
're O
going O
to O
support O
them O

And O
obviously O
we O
're O

pray O
that O

... O
NOVAK S-PER
Are O
you O
going O

them O

SANDERS S-PER
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
demonstrate O
against O
anybody O
during O
a O
war O
. O

But O
let O
's O
be O
clear O
. O

The O
president O
almost O
unilaterally O
is O
putting O
us O
in O
this O
position O
against O
world O
opinion O
. O

NOVAK S-PER
Did O
n't O
the B-ORG

it O
? O

I O

SANDERS S-PER

back O

And O
I O

it O

You O
said O

" O
This O

Saddam B-PER

I O

would O
that O

accurately O

him O
in O
1988 O
? O

HAYWORTH S-PER
Oh O
, O
yes O
. O

I O
think O
it O
does O
. O

I O
think O
it O
has O
described O
him O
, O
especially O
since O
he O
's O
taken O
basically O
a O
one-man O
rule O
over O
with O
the B-ORG
Baath M-ORG
Party E-ORG
in O
1979 O
. O

BEGALA S-PER
I O
agree O

Therefore O
, O
was O

Dick B-PER
Cheney E-PER

as O
the O
CEO O

wrong O
to O
be O

HAYWORTH S-PER

I O

happen O
in O
this O

For O
example O
-- O
wait O
a O

-- O
in O
Iran S-GPE
, O
the O
reason O
that O
you O
had O
Ayatollah B-PER

is O
he O
overthrew O
the O

NOVAK S-PER
I O
want O
to O
get O

point O

But O
the O
problem O

Khomeini S-PER

the O
guy O
who O
he O

put O

I O

quite O
figure O

We O

put O

the O
problem O
was O
Khomeini S-PER

SANDERS S-PER
No O

the O
point O
I O
made O

Khomeini S-PER
came O

because O
we O
put O
a O

dictator O
, O
the O
Shah O
of O

in O

The O
point O

I O

is O
you O
can O
not O

point O
you O

that O
was O
on O
christmas O

her O

scott S-PER
, O
at O
the O
time O
said O
that O
he O
was O
fishing O
in O
the B-LOC
berkeley M-LOC
marina E-LOC
. O

now O
, O
in O
a O
strange O
twist O
in O
all O
of O
this O
, O
just O
yesterday O
separate O
from O
the O
skeletal O
remains O
i O
alluded O
to O
earlier O
a O
man O
hiking O
near O
the B-LOC
berkeley M-LOC
marina E-LOC
found O
a O
bone O
, O
and O
they O
are O
now O
looking O
at O
that O
as O
another O
possible O
lead O
in O
this O
case O
. O

this O
person O
came O
across O
the O
bone O
at O
the O
shore O
. O

he O
brought O
it O
home O
and O
contacted O
the O
authorities O
, O
and O
we O
took O
possession O
of O
it O
. O

and O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
the O
other O
-- O
well O
, O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
find O
out O
if O
it O
's O
a O
human O
bone O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
is O
related O
to O
the O
others O
. O

reporter O
: O
and O
yet O
another O
reason O
why O
that O
bone O
could O
be O
a O
key O
link O
, O
there O
are O
reports O
that O
have O
surfaced O
that O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
female O
remains O
that O
were O
found O
the O
skeleton O
was O
not O
completely O
intact O
. O

now O
this O
case O
is O
also O
taking O
on O
a O
rather O
, O
we O
should O
say O
, O
almost O
a O
tv O
episodic O
forensic O
pathology O
angle O
because O
they O
're O
going O
to O
bring O
in O
an O
expert O
on O
what O
's O
called O
alufating O
decay O
, O
and O
basically O
this O
person O
is O
going O
to O
come O
in O
here O
and O
look O
at O
the O
body O
. O

this O
is O
in O
the O
damage O
aspect O
of O
it O
. O

and O
they O
say O
these O
experts O
will O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
how O
long O
the O
body O
had O
been O
in O
there O
and O
if O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
almost O
full-term O
baby O
boy O
were O
inside O
the O
female O
's O
remains O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
. O

also O
, O
the O
coroner O
could O
know O
right O
now O
but O
is O
not O
saying O
if O
there O
was O
some O
sort O
of O
trauma O
to O
either O
of O
these O
skeletons O
, O
for O
example O
, O
if O
they O
could O
see O
the O
bone O
compromised O
in O
some O
way O
they O
could O
tell O
if O
there O
had O
been O
a O
stab O
or O
a O
shooting O
. O

we O
may O
learn O
a O
lot O
more O
on O
this O
in O
just O
15 O
minutes O
. O

that O
's O
because O
modesto S-GPE
police O
have O
scheduled O
a O
news O
conference O
and O
while O
they O
may O
not O

are O
we O

is O
there O
any O
reason O
for O

expect O
that O
there O
would O
be O
the O
ability O
to O
identify O
those O
remains O
as O
a O
result O
of O
these O
autopsies O
this O
afternoon O
? O

reporter O
: O
it O
sounds O
like O
all O
of O
this O
will O
be O
too O
quick O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
underlying O
all O
this O
is O
there O
could O
be O
an O
absence O
of O
dental O
records O
. O

that O
's O
particularly O
important O
for O
the O
adult O
female O

. O

so O
now O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
turn O
to O
dna O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
they O
're O
calling O
in O
these O

. O

some O
dna O
testing O
can O
be O
very O

sometimes O
it O

is O
an O
islamic O
movement O

at O
the O
very O
beginning O
, O
it O
was O
encouraged O
by O
israel S-GPE
because O
they O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
counter O

what O

the O

and O
to O
survive O
. O

right O
. O

well O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
the O
spacecraft O
would O
not O
be O
launched O
from O
earth S-LOC
. O

you O
'd O
have O
to O
launch O
is O
from O
in O
space O
already O
, O
which O
means O
we O
would O
have O
to O
build O
it O
in O
space O
. O

so O
that O
means O
we O
need O
a O
good O
shuttle O
that O
's O
going O
to O
take O
us O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
build O
the O
spacecraft O
. O

then O
we O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
the O
fuel O
that O
will O
take O
it O
out O
of O
the B-LOC
earth E-LOC
's O
orbit O
all O
the O
way O
to O
mars S-LOC
. O

that O
's O
probably O
going O
to O
be O
nuclear O
propulsion O
at O
this O
point O
again O
something O
we O
have O
n't O
really O
developed O
yet O
, O
because O
we O
could O
n't O
carry O
that O
much O
fuel O
, O
obviously O
. O

liquid O
oxygen O
would O
be O
way O
too O
heavy O
to O
carry O
all O
the O
way O
to O
mars S-LOC
. O

the O
bigger O
issue O
is O
once O
we O
get O
there O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
carry O
oxygen O
or O
water O
or O
food O
to O
stay O
there O
three O
years O
, O
so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
do O
all O
of O
that O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
planet O
. O

and O
think O
of O
it O
. O

mars S-LOC
is O
carbon O
dioxide O
. O

so O
we O
ca O
n't O
breathe O
there O
. O

so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
some O
conversion O
technique O
to O
create O
water O
, O
to O
create O
oxygen O
and O
then O
some O
way O
of O
growing O
food O
on O
the O
planet O
itself O
. O

all O
of O
this O
is O
in O
the O
works O
now O
, O
but O
i O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
quite O
a O
few O
years O
to O
develop O
it O
. O

you O
talk O
about O
the O
cosmic O
radiation O
. O

then O
of O
course O
there O
is O
the O
zero O
g O
bone O
loss O
, O
almost O
like O
the O
eroding O
of O
bone O
to O
humans O
that O
would O
be O
at O
risk O
as O
well O
. O

absolutely O
. O

there O
could O
be O
as O
much O
as O
50 O
% O
bone O
loss O
in O
astronauts O
in O
mars S-LOC
. O

why O
? O

during O
the O
time O
in O
mars S-LOC
. O

because O
when O
the O
body O
has O
-- O
when O
there O
is O
no O
dpravity O
as O
there O
is O
on O
mars S-LOC
, O
the O
body O
does O
n't O
pick O
up O
the O
calcium O
in O
the O
bones O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
keep O
getting O
the O
bones O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
. O

so O
they O
will O
just O
lose O
it O
. O

they O
will O
be O
almost O
like O
old O
people O
even O
at O
the O
age O
of O
40 O
. O

that O

Right O

I O
mean O
we O
're O
seeing O
one O
of O
the O
great O
advantages O
of O
U.S. S-GPE
and O
British S-GPE
forces O
now O
, O
Judy S-PER
, O
which O
is O
that O
they O
're O
superbly O
trained O
troops O
. O

They O
have O
training O
in O
a O
whole O
variety O
of O
different O
missions O
and O
they O
're O
adapting O
. O

They O
recognize O
now O
they O
went O
in O
with O
some O
false O
assumptions O
about O
the O
kind O
of O
reception O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
face O
. O

The O
plan O
that O
was O
implemented O
had O
some O
inherent O
risks O
in O
it O
, O
risks O
to O
the O
supply O
line O
, O
risks O
in O
terms O
of O
not O
clearing O
cities O
and O
they O
're O
shifting O
. O

They O
're O
changing O
and O
the O
troops O
are O
trained O
well O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
that O
. O

You O
've O
seen O
U.S. B-ORG
Central M-ORG
Command E-ORG
bringing O
up O
additional O
forces O
like O
the B-ORG
82nd M-ORG
Airborne M-ORG
Division E-ORG
to O
better O
deal O
with O
these O
long O
supply O
lines O
, O
get O
control O
over O
the O
cities O
and O
so O
I O
think O
that O
U.S. S-GPE
and O
British S-GPE
forces O
are O
beginning O
to O
stabilize O
the O
battlefield O
. O

WOODRUFF S-PER
So O
as O
an O
onlooker O
, O
as O
somebody O
who O
's O
studied O
the O
Iraqi S-GPE
capabilities O
, O
is O
it O
your O
sense O
that O
the O
coalition O
can O
continue O
to O
adjust O
to O
whatever O
they O
deal O
with O
? O

POLLACK S-PER
Absolutely O
. O

One O
of O
the O
things O
I O
think O
we O
're O
likely O
to O
see O
is O
that O
the O
Iraqis O
are O
going O
to O
have O
a O
tougher O
time O
adapting O
than O
U.S. S-GPE
forces O
are O
. O

Typically O
what O
you O
've O
seen O
in O
the O
Iraqi S-GPE
armed O
forces O
is O
the O
change O
has O
to O
come O
from O
the O
top O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
come O
from O
the O
ground O
up O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
ground O
commanders O
calling O
back O
and O
saying O
hey O
, O
we O
'd O
like O
to O
try O
this O
tactic O
or O
this O
seems O
to O
work O
. O

Tell O
everybody O
else O
to O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Instead O
the O
high O
command O
has O
to O
identify O
a O
problem O
, O
come O
up O
with O
a O
solution O
and O
transmit O
it O
down O
. O

Chances O
are O
the O
Iraqis O
are O
going O
to O
continue O
to O
stick O
with O
what O
we O
've O
seen O
before O
, O
irregular O
forces O
blending O
in O
with O
civilians O
trying O
to O
attack O
U.S. S-GPE
forces O
, O
some O
more O
of O
these O
suicide O
attacks O
which O
are O
going O
to O
be O
problematic O
for O
our O
troops O
. O

There O
's O
no O
way O
around O
that O
but O
U.S. S-GPE
forces O
, O
British S-GPE
forces O
are O
beginning O
to O
adapt O
to O
it O
. O

WOODRUFF S-PER
I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
about O
you O
mentioned O
coalition O
forces O
going O
in O
expecting O
more O
support O
from O
ordinary O
Iraqi S-GPE
people O
. O

I O
just O
interviewed O
a O
gentleman O
, O
native O
of O
Iraq S-GPE
, O
who O
talks O
to O
his O
family O
there O
all O
the O
time O
and O
he O
says O
they O
live O
in O
Baghdad S-GPE
20 O
, O
30 O
, O
50 O
of O
them O
and O
he O
said O
they O
do O
the O
view O
the O
Americans O
as O
invaders O
. O

They O
hate O
Saddam B-PER
Hussein E-PER
. O

They O
do O
n't O
like O
what O
he O
's O
doing O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
Americans O
are O
the O
answer O
. O

POLLACK S-PER
All O
right O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
something O
that O
we O
've O
been O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
grip O
on O
for O
years O
, O
exactly O
what O
the O
Iraqi S-GPE
people O
feel O
and O
also O
that O
I O
think O
the O
best O
evidence O
that O
we O
had O
before O
the O
attack O
began O
was O
that O
Iraqis O
do O
, O
they O
despise O
. O

They O
are O
desperate O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
him O
but O
by O
the O
same O
token O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
like O
another O
country O
coming O
into O
their O
country O
to O
overturn O
the O
government O
and O
beyond O
that O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
probably O
most O
important O
for O
most O
Iraqis O
is O
they O
're O
deeply O
suspicious O
of O
the B-GPE
United M-GPE
States E-GPE
. O

They O
remember O
that O
the B-GPE
United M-GPE
States E-GPE
betrayed O
them O
in O
1991 O
. O

The B-GPE
U.S. E-GPE
did O
n't O
finish O
Saddam S-PER
then O
. O

President B-PER
Bush E-PER
- O
then O
President B-PER
Bush E-PER
called O
on O
them O
to O
rise O
up O
and O
then O
the B-GPE
U.S. E-GPE
did O
nothing O
and O
so O
they O
're O
deeply O
suspicious O
of O
what O
we O
have O
in O
mind O
. O

WOODRUFF S-PER
Which O
raises O
questions O
going O
forward O
. O

One O
last O
thing O
, O
Ken B-PER
Pollack E-PER
I O
want O
to O
ask O
about O
this O
British S-GPE
officials O
saying O
that O
they O
have O
information O
that O
Saddam B-PER
Hussein E-PER
has O
fired O
his O
air O
defense O
chief O
. O

What O
's O
the O
significance O
of O
that O
? O

POLLACK S-PER
Well O
, O
if O
it O
's O

obviously O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
just O
yet O
but O
if O
it O
's O
true O
, O
it O
is O
very O
significant O
because O
it O
's O
effectively O
the O
Iraqis O
admitting O
that O
many O
of O
the O
civilian O
casualties O
that O
we O
've O

Exactly O

in O

I O
think O
it O
was O
pretty O
apparent O
when O
you O
looked O
at O
the O

of O
that O

, O
if O
that O
had O
been O
a O

or O
a O

, O
that O

are O
it O

In O

, O
there O
is O
no O

one O

we O

Military O
people O
are O
very O
superstitious O

like O
many O

Here O
at O

the O
candy O

many O
of O

refuse O

They O

keep O
their O
Charms O
in O

not O

one O

superstitious O

I O
'm O

Gary S-PER

one O
another O
quick O
question O

you O
. O

That O
air O
base O
that O
coalition O
forces O
have O
now O
taken O
control O
of O
near O
Nasiriya S-GPE

Are O
you O
able O
to O
say O
, O
are O
they O
actually O
using O
it O
or O
getting O
much O
use O
out O
of O
it O
? O

TUCHMAN S-PER
What O
they O
are O
doing O
, O
Judy S-PER
, O
some O
of O
these O
A-10s O
behind O
me O
go O
there O
to O
refuel O
, O
to O
stage O
operations O
further O
north O

They O
also O
fly O
these O
HH-60 S-VEH
helicopters O
, O
they O
're O
the O
search O
and O
rescue O
helicopters O
used O
in O
case O
they O
have O
to O
search O
and O
find O
somebody O
on O
the O

They O
stage O
there O
and O
refuel O

right O

, O
none O
of O
them O

Laith B-PER
Kubba E-PER
is O
an O

who O

talk O

Mr. B-PER
Kubba E-PER
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
your O
thoughts O
as O
you O
've O
watched O
these O
scenes O
of O
Baghdad S-GPE
, O
the O
Saddam B-PER
Hussein E-PER
regime O
falling O

the O

LAITH B-PER
KUBBA E-PER
, O
PRESIDENT O
, O
IRAQI B-ORG
NATIONAL M-ORG
GROUP E-ORG
It O
is O
a O
huge O
sigh O
of O
relief O
, O
because O
it O
could O
have O
been O
much O
worse O
and O
Baghdad S-GPE
could O
have O
been O
a O
war O
theater O
with O
more O
destruction O
to O
property O
. O

And O
, O
obviously O
, O
there O
are O
four O
million O
people O
who O
could O
have O
suffered O
more O
. O

So O
, O
there O
is O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O
that O
it O
is O
not O
worse O
. O

But O
, O
obviously O
, O
there O
is O
a O
great O
, O
great O
concern O
about O
the O
scenes O
that O
you O
've O
been O
showing O
on O
television O
. O

WOODRUFF S-PER
Are O
you O
talking O
to O
family O
members O
now O
in O
Baghdad S-GPE
and O
around O
Iraq S-GPE
? O

And O
, O
if O
you O
are O
, O
how O
concerned O
are O
they O
about O
the O
lawlessness O
? O

KUBBA S-PER
Well O
, O
not O
in O
the O
recent O
three O
or O
four O
days O
. O

There O
are O
no O
phone O
lines O
to O
Baghdad S-GPE
. O

In O
other O
parts O
of O
Iraq S-GPE
, O
I O
received O
with O
great O
sadness O
the O
killing O
of O
one O
close O
colleague O
, O
Saeed B-PER
Abu M-PER
Naji M-PER
Abhuey E-PER
( O
ph O
) O
in O
Najaf S-GPE
. O

He O
was O
not O
killed O
by O
former O
members O
of O
the B-ORG
Baath M-ORG
Party E-ORG
or O
the O
security O
of O
the O
army O
, O
but O
by O
just O
a O
local O
organized O
group O
. O

So O
those O
signs O
to O
me O
are O
worrying O
. O

People O
are O
sensing O
and O
feeling O
the O
lack O
of O
authority O
or O
the O
power O
vacuum O
and O
are O
testing O
it O
. O

And O
the O
more O
they O
test O
, O
the O
more O
I O
think O
they O
are O
claiming O
. O

WOODRUFF S-PER
How O
difficult O
will O
it O
be O
to O
sort O
out O
who O
will O
next O
hold O
power O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
after O
this O
transition O
period O
, O
however O
long O
it O
is O
, O
where O
the B-GPE
U.S. E-GPE
is O
in O
charge O
? O

KUBBA S-PER
Well O
, O
one O
needs O
to O
break O
down O
this O
process O
into O
various O
elements O
. O

Today O
, O
there O
should O
be O
an O
authority O
. O

And O
it O
's O
very O
likely O
that O
the B-GPE
U.S. E-GPE
and O
the O
British S-GPE
forces O
are O
the O
authority O
on O
land O
. O

And O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
administration O
. O

And O
this O
ought O
to O
be O
primarily O
by O
Iraqis O
. O

But O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
government O
, O
I O
think O
we O
really O
need O
to O
map O
out O
step O
by O
step O
how O
to O
move O
from O
this O
power O
vacuum O
to O
the O
day O
we O
have O
elections O
. O

We O
need O
to O
involve O
the B-ORG
U.N E-ORG
. O

We O
need O
to O
involve O
all O
Iraqi S-GPE
forces O
in O
the O
country O
, O
outside O
the O
country O
. O

But O
we O
need O
to O
do O
it O
quickly O
, O
because O
every O
day O
passes O
by O
with O
this O
vacuum O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
spell O
trouble O
. O

WOODRUFF S-PER
Well O
, O
we O
know O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Kubba E-PER
, O
there O
are O
several O
Iraqi S-GPE
exiles O
groups O
competing O
for O
influence O
. O

Is O
one O
of O
them O
going O
to O
have O
an O
advantage O
? O

And O
, O
particularly O
, O
I O
have O
in O
mind O
the B-ORG
Iraqi M-ORG
National M-ORG
Congress E-ORG
that O
Mr. B-PER
Chalabi M-PER
, M-PER
who M-PER
was M-PER
assisted M-PER
by M-PER
U.S. M-PER
forces M-PER
in M-PER
getting M-PER
back M-PER
into M-PER
Iraq E-PER
? O

KUBBA S-PER
I O
think O
it O
's O
one O
thing O
to O
gain O
fame O
and O
access O
to O
Washington S-GPE
. O

It O
's O
totally O
another O
to O
gain O
legitimacy O
and O
functioning O
grounds O
inside O
Iraq S-GPE
. O

And O
I O
think O
plans O
must O
not O
be O
drawn O
in O
thin O
air O
out O
in O
Washington S-GPE
. O

It O
must O
really O
be O
drawn O
on O
the O
ground O
inside O
Iraq S-GPE
. O

And O
there O
are O
22 O
million O
people O
there O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
void O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
vacuum O
. O

And O
I O
think O
all O
plans O
must O
be O
anchored O
there O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
in O
its O
reality O
. O

WOODRUFF S-PER
So O
does O
one O
group O
have O
an O
advantage O
over O
another O
now O
? O

KUBBA S-PER
There O
are O
different O
groups O
who O
have O
advantage O
over O
others O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
national O
group O
that O
can O
appeal O
to O
Iraqis O
as O
Iraqis O
within O
a O
credible O
voice.This O
needs O
to O
be O
constructed O
, O
maybe O
through O
a O
conference O
to O
be O
held O
in O
Baghdad S-GPE
, O
where O
representatives O
from O
provinces O
all O
over O
Iraq S-GPE
need O
to O
participate O
, O
as O
well O
as O
political O
groups O
. O

But O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
single O
group O
, O
a O
single O
leadership O
or O
a O
single O
council O
yet O
. O

This O
recent O
news O
story O
is O
troubling O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
. O

When O
I O
first O
heard O
of O
the O
story O
I O
figured O
it O
was O
some O
wackjob O
playing O
with O
a O
new O
toy O
but O
now O
we O
find O
out O
there O
have O
been O
7 O
incidents O
since O
Christmas O
from O
the O
West O
to O
East O
coast O
. O

The B-ORG
FBI E-ORG
, O
concerned O
that O
terrorists O
could O
use O
lasers O
as O
weapons O
, O
is O
investigating O
why O
laser O
beams O
were O
directed O
into O
the O
cockpits O
of O
seven O
airplanes O
in O
flight O
since O
Christmas O
. O

Laser O
beams O
can O
temporarily O
blind O
or O
disorient O
pilots O
and O
possibly O
cause O
a O
plane O
to O
crash O
. O

The B-ORG
FBI E-ORG
is O
looking O
into O
two O
incidents O
in O
Colorado B-GPE

according O

some O

A O
federal O
law O

said O
Thursday O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
plot O
or O
terrorist O
activity O
. O

But O
pilots O
are O
troubled O
by O
the O
incidents O

and O
the B-ORG
FBI E-ORG
earlier O
this O

warned O
of O
the O
possibility O
that O

Michelle B-PER
Malkin E-PER
has O
a O
post O
about O
this O
today O
where O
some O
outlets O
have O
stopped O
selling O
lasers O
. O

Lots O
of O
people O
think O
that O
these O
indeed O
might O
be O
loonies O
playing O
with O
new O
Christmas O
toys O
but O
I O
disagree O
. O

These O
are O
incidents O
where O
the O
Airplanes O
were O
tracked O
, O
some O
as O
high O
as O
8500 O
feet O
. O

To O
track O
a O
fast O
moving O
plane O
at O
that O
altitude O
would O
not O
be O
some O
toy O
you O
can O
get O
from O
the B-ORG
local M-ORG
wal-mart E-ORG
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
this O
is O
quite O
alarming O
. O

This O
Is O
n't O
Writing O
, O
It O

Typing O

a O
great O
post O
out O
with O
a O
ton O
of O
info O
, O
some O
of O
it O
quite O
scary O
A O
more O
frightening O
scenario O
is O
that O
terrorists O
may O
have O
obtained O
a O
Chinese-produced S-GPE
ZM-87 O
laser O
blinder O
which O
is O
specifically O
designed O
to O
blind O
eyesight O
. O

The O
Japanese S-GPE
terrorist O
cult O
Aum B-ORG
Shinrikyo E-ORG
-- O
which O
launched O
the O
infamous O
Sarin O
gas O
attack O
on O
the O
Tokyo S-GPE
subway O
system O
in O
1995 O
-- O
was O
discovered O
to O
have O
experimented O
with O
the O
use O
of O
lasers O
as O
weapons.According O
to O
The B-ORG
Asian M-ORG

Post E-ORG
, O
" O
Cult O
members O
apparently O
obtained O
laser O
design O
information O
from O
Russian S-GPE
institutes O
they O
visited O
and O
built O
a O
laser O
weapon O
mounted O
on O
a O
truck O
. O

They O
had O
planned O
to O
use O
the O
laser O
against O
Tokyo S-GPE
policemen O
, O
but O
the O
plan O
failed O
when O
the O
laser O
malfunctioned O
during O
the O
testing O
stage O
. O
" O

PoliticAlex S-PER
also O
has O
some O
info O
on O
this O
story O
also O
. O

I O
found O
the O
following O
report O
that O
was O
presented O
to O
Congress S-ORG
recently O
about O
the O
shoulder O
launched O
missle O
threat O
to O
airliners O
, O
which O
this O
might O
very O
well O
be O
a O
precursor O
to O
: O
Recent O
events O
have O
focused O
attention O
on O
the O
threat O
that O
terrorists O
with O
shoulder O
fired O
surface-to-air O
missiles O
( O
SAMs S-WEA
) O
, O
referred O
to O
as O
Man-Portable B-WEA
Air M-WEA
Defense M-WEA
Systems E-WEA
( O
MANPADS S-WEA
) O
, O
pose O
to O
commercial O
airliners O
. O

Most O
believe O
that O
no O
single O
solution O
exists O
to O
effectively O
mitigate O
this O
threat O
. O

Instead O
, O
a O
menu O
of O
options O
may O
be O
considered O
, O
including O
installing O
infrared O
( O
IR O
) O
countermeasures O
on O
aircraft O
; O
modifying O
flight O
operations O
and O
air O
traffic O
control O
procedures O
; O
improving O
airport O
and O
regional O
security O
; O
and O
strengthening O
missile O
non-proliferation O
efforts O
. O

Equipping O
aircraft O
with O
missile O
countermeasure O
systems O
can O
protect O
the O
aircraft O
even O
when O
operating O
in O
areas O
where O
ground-based O
security O
measures O
are O
unavailable O
or O
infeasible O
to O
implement O
. O

However O
, O
this O
option O
has O
a O
relatively O
high O
cost O
, O
between O
$ O
1 O
million O
and O
$ O
3 O
million O
per O
aircraft O
, O
and O
the O
time O
needed O
for O
implementation O
does O
not O
allow O
for O
immediate O
response O
to O
the O
existing O
terrorist O
threat O
. O

Procedural O
improvements O
such O
as O
specific O
flight O
crew O
training O
, O
altering O
air O
traffic O
procedures O
to O
minimize O
exposure O
to O
the O
threat O
, O
and O
improved O
security O
near O
airports O
may O
be O
less O
costly O
than O
countermeasures O
and O
could O
more O
immediately O
help O
deter O
domestic O
terrorist O
attacks O
. O

However O
, O
these O
techniques O
by O
themselves O
can O
not O
completely O
mitigate O
the O
risk O
of O
domestic O
attacks O
and O
would O
not O
protect O
U.S. S-GPE
airliners O
flying O
to O
and O
from O
foreign O
airports O
. O

Legislation O
introduced O
in O
the O
108th O
Congress O
( O
H.R. O
580 O
, O
S. O
311 O
) O
calls O
for O
the O
installation O
of O
missile O
defense O
systems O
in O
all O
turbojet O
aircraft O
used O
in O
scheduled O
air O
carrier O
service O
. O

While O
this O
legislation O
is O
still O
under O
consideration O
, O
Homeland B-ORG
Security E-ORG
appropriations O
designated O
$ O
60 O
million O
in O

prototype O
missile O
countermeasure O
systems O
for O
commercial O
aircraft O

on O

all O

It O

now O

just O

you O

the O
one O
above O

here O

a O
great O

I O
read O
today O
: O
A O
man O
takes O
his O
Rottweiler O
to O
the O
vet O
and O
says O
, O
" O
My O
dog O
's O
cross-eyed O
, O
is O
there O
anything O
you O
can O
do O
for O
him O
? O
" O

" O
Well O
, O
" O
says O
the O
vet O
, O
" O
let O
's O
have O
a O
look O
at O
him O
. O
" O

So O
he O
picks O
the O
dog O
up O
and O
examines O
his O
eyes O
, O
then O
checks O
his O
teeth O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
vet O
says O
" O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
have O
to O
put O
him O
down O
. O
" O

" O
What O
? O

Because O
he O
's O
cross-eyed O
? O
" O

" O
No O
, O
because O
he O
's O
really O
heavy O
. O
" O

I O
will O
be O
breaking O
down O
the O
SEC S-ORG
championship O
game O
either O
later O
today O
or O
tomorrow O
, O
so O
I O
expect O
you O
all O
to O
be O
planted O
firmly O
on O
the O
edge O

waiting O

Ferguson S-PER
was O
finally O
removed O
via O
stretcher O
, O
giving O
a O
thumbs O
up O
to O
the O
crowd O
on O
the O
way O
out O
. O

The B-ORG
Packers E-ORG
went O
on O
to O
lose O
the O
game O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
the O
story O
here O
. O

This O
was O
not O
one O
of O
the O
staged O
stiff-armed O
clotheslines O
you O
see O
in O
professional O
wrestling O
broadcasts O
. O

This O
was O
a O
vicious O
, O
arm O
cocked O
and O
swinging O
clothesline O
that O
literally O
could O
have O
torn O
Ferguson S-PER
's O
head O
off O
of O
his O
body O
. O

The O
play O
was O
immediately O
flagged O
, O
and O
moments O
later O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
Darius S-PER
had O
been O
ejected O
, O
much O
to O
the O
crowd O
's O
delight O
. O

One O
sidenote O
here O
is O
that O
, O
despite O
their O
rabid O
fandom O
and O
the O
situation O
, O
not O
one O
thing O
was O
thrown O
at O
the O
offending O
player O
as O
he O
left O
the O
field O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
easy O
to O
bathe O
him O
in O
beer O
or O
snowballs O
or O
batteries O
as O
he O
left O
, O
but O
the O
Packer S-ORG
fans O
are O
classier O
than O
that O
. O

To O
a O
person O
, O
they O
acted O
with O
class O
, O
using O
their O
voices O
and O
not O
projectiles O
to O
express O
their O
displeasure O
. O

This O
was O
the O
most O
vicious O
and O
blatantly O
dirty O
play O
I O
have O
seen O
in O
the B-ORG
NFL E-ORG
since O
Jim B-PER
McMahon E-PER
was O
body O
slammed O
to O
the O
ground O
in O
the O
mid O
80 O
's O
about O
five O
seconds O
after O
he O
had O
released O
a O
pass O
. O

And O
Jaguars B-PER
coach M-PER
Jack M-PER
Del M-PER
Rio E-PER
and O
Darius S-PER
had O
the O
nerve O
to O
vociferously O
argue O
with O
officials O
about O
Darius S-PER
' O
ejection O
from O
the O
game O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
care O
what O
anyone O
says O
about O
" O
you O
ca O
n't O
judge O
intent O
. O
" O

Darius S-PER
' O
intent O
was O
to O
dismember O
, O
injure O
or O
even O
kill O
Ferguson S-PER
. O

The O
more O
I O
saw O
the O
replay O
, O
the O
sicker O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
. O

The O
league O
must O
take O
action O
, O
and O
it O
must O
be O
swift O
and O
sure O
. O

I O
'm O
talking O
about O
a O
four O
game O
suspension O
that O
included O
the O
playoffs O
if O
necessary O
. O

In O
this O
day O
and O
age O
of O
bigger O
, O
stronger O
and O
faster O
players O
, O
injuries O
are O
going O
to O
happen O
accidentally O
all O
of O
the O
time O
. O

There O
is O
simply O
no O
room O
for O
the O
kind O
of O
play O
that O
resulted O
in O
Ferguson S-PER
's O
injury O
. O

Paul B-PER
Tagliabue E-PER
must O
give O
word O
to O
all O
of O
his O
employees O
that O
actions O
like O
this O
will O
not O
be O
tolerated O
. O

Maybe O
that O
will O
tell O
the B-ORG
Jaguars E-ORG
, O
Darius S-PER
and O
players O
like O
him O
that O
this O
kind O
of O
head-hunting O
will O
not O
be O
tolerated O
in O
the B-ORG
NFL E-ORG
. O

If O
not O
, O
I O
fully O
expect O
the B-ORG
Packers E-ORG
and O
many O
other O
teams O
to O
handle O
this O
matter O
" O
on O
the O
field O
" O
with O
Darius S-PER
being O
the O
target O
of O
similar O
attacks O
by O
tight O
ends O
and O
offensive O
lineman O
. O

I O

It O

after O

gone O
for O
ten O

, O
but O
I O
think O
it O

tougher O
to O
stay O

try O
to O
do O
what O
my O

every O

the O

I O
am O
happy O
she O
left O
the O

and O
took O
responsibility O
for O
it O
, O
but O
what O
in O
the O
fuck O
is O
going O
on O
that O
every O
couple O

months O
I O
'm O
taking O
cars O
to O
the O
shop O
for O
things O
that O
are O
not O
my O
fault O
? O

This O
is O
the O
third O
incident O
in O
15 O
months O
, O
and O
two O
of O
the O
three O
involved O
other O
folks O
hitting O
my O

I O
knew O
my O
20 O

clean O

would O
end O
sometime O

but O
do O
the O
karma O
Gods O
have O
to O
beat O
me O
over O
the O
head O
with O
a O
shovel O
about O
it O

So O
today O
I O
had O
Enterprise S-ORG
pick O
me O
up O
at O
7:15 O
, O
which O
was O
great O
. O

I O
was O
worried O
about O
being O
late O
to O
work O
and O
, O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
, O
I O
was O
only O
16 O
minutes O
late O
. O

I O
was O
given O
a O
choice O
between O
a B-VEH

an B-VEH

I O
took O
the B-VEH
impala E-VEH
. O

I O
made O
the O
wrong O
choice O
. O

It O
drives O

So O
much O
for O
my O
GM S-ORG
loyalty O
. O

They O
make O
great O

, O
but O
their O

I O
will O
return O

Friday O
, O
only O
to O

the O

I O
actually O

Commissioner B-PER
Gary M-PER
Bettman E-PER
announced O
the O
cancellation O
of O
the O
2004-2005 O
NHL S-ORG
season O
. O

As O
if O
everyone O
did O
n't O
already O
know O
that O
was O
the O
case O
. O

Shame O
on O
the B-ORG
NHL E-ORG
and O
shame O
on O
the O
players O
' O
association O
for O
not O
getting O
a O
deal O
done O
, O
but O
I O
put O
much O
more O
of O
the O
blame O
on O
the O
owners O
as O
this O
" O
negotiation O
" O
came O
down O
to O
the O
wire O
. O

I O
understand O
that O
the O
league O
was O
losing O
less O
money O
by O
not O
playing O
than O
it O
would O
have O
by O
having O
a O
season O
this O
year O
. O

I O
also O
understand O
that O
when O
push O
came O
to O
shove O
, O
the O
players O
gave O
in O
and O
accepted O
a O
salary O
cap O
. O

Okay O
, O
the O
sides O
were O
about O
7 O
million O
per O
team O
apart O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
they O
just O
say O
" O
alright O
, O
let O
's O
split O
that O
in O
half O
and O
play O
hockey O
? O
" O

I O
mean O
Holy B-PER
Christ E-PER
people O
, O
two O
kids O
arguing O
over O
10 O
bucks O
would O
work O
it O
out O
that O
way O
. O

Why O
is O
this O
any O
different O
? O

The B-ORG
NHL E-ORG
's O
primary O
goal O
was O
to O
get O
a O
salary O
cap O
approved O
by O
the O
players O
, O
and O
they O
finally O
did O
. O

And O
what O
did O
the B-ORG
NHL E-ORG
do O
when O
that O
momentus O
event O
occurred O
? O

They O
left O
the O
negotiating O
table O
. O

Gary B-PER
Bettman E-PER
is O
a O
mindless O
troll O
and O
the O
professional O
sports O
commissioner O
equivalent O
of O
Joe B-PER
Hazelwood E-PER
and O
this O
lockout O
/ O
strike O
/ O
cluster O
fuck O
is O
the O
reef O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
that O
needs O
to O
happen O
is O
that O
Bettman S-PER
and O
Goodenow S-PER
( O
the B-ORG
players M-ORG
' M-ORG
association E-ORG
rep O
) O
need O
to O
be O
fired O
, O
deported O
, O
flogged O
, O
tarred O
and O
feathered O
and O
finally O
forced O
to O
pay O
for O
four O
tickets O
plus O
a O
program O
, O
four O
dogs O
, O
four O
beers O
, O
and O
two O
cokes O
and O
parking O
to O
a O
game O
at O
an O
NHL S-ORG
arena O
for O
every O
day O
of O
the O
next O
season O
so O
they O
understand O
what O
the O
fans O
go O
thru O
to O
see O
a O
hockey O
game O
. O

Then O
, O
all O
current O
contracts O
need O
to O
be O
voided O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
in O
2006 O
. O

That O
means O
no O
team O
would O
own O
any O
player O
, O
and O
the O
owners O
would O
be O
free O
to O
sign O
whomever O
they O
'd O
like O
using O
the O
" O
fiscal O
restraint O
" O
they O
all O
droned O
on O
and O
on O
about O
all O
year O
. O

That O
way O
, O
they O
'd O
only O
pay O
as O
much O
as O
they O
could O
afford O
... O
right O
? O

Wrong O
. O

Those O
douchebags O
would O
end O
up O
overspending O
like O
every O
professional O
sports O
owner O
because O
they O
ca O
n't O
control O
themselves O
. O

If O
Mr. B-PER
Iginla E-PER
or O
Heatley S-PER
were O
free O
agents O
, O
for O
example O
, O
owners O
would O
bid O
each O
other O
out O
of O
their O
minds O
, O
then O
they O
'd O
be O
left O
with O
not O
enough O
to O
get O
a O
competetive O
team O
. O

While O
the O
business O
model O
in O
the B-ORG
NHL E-ORG
was O
certainly O
flawed O
and O
the O
owners O
needed O
help O
, O
they O
really O
needed O
help O
to O
protect O
them O
from O
themselves O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
without O
that O
help O
, O
the O
owners O
would O
follow O
the O
same O
path O
that O
got O
them O
where O
they O
are O
right O
now O
anyway O
. O

The O
biggest O
issue O
is O
this O
, O
however O
. O

Very O
few O
people O
give O
one O
hot O
shit O
whether O
the B-ORG
NHL E-ORG
plays O
another O
game O
ever O
, O
let O
alone O
this O

or O
the O
next O
one O

For O
every O

there O
are O
1,000 O

may O
opt O
out O

that O
all O

HUGE O
trouble O

no O

no O

Atlanta S-GPE
lost O

the B-ORG

no O

contract O
. O

Hell O
, O
Major B-ORG
League M-ORG
Soccer E-ORG

WNBA E-ORG
DO O
have O
a O
tv O
contract O
and O
no O
one O
gives O
a O
shit O
about O
them O

I O
'll O
say O
this O
for O
the B-ORG

, O
when O
they O
screw O
up O
, O
they O
screw O
up O
huge O
. O

Congrats O

will O
forever O
be O
