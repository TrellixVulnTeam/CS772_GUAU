we	O

something	O

the	O

they	O

that	O

's	O

is	O
it	O
your	O
sense	O
that	O
the	O

can	O
continue	O
to	O

to	O
whatever	O
they	O
deal	O

?	O

POLLACK	B-PER
Absolutely	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
're	O
likely	O
to	O
see	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
Iraqis	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
tougher	O
time	O
adapting	O
than	O
U.S.	B-GPE
forces	O
are	O
.	O

Typically	O
what	O
you	O
've	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
Iraqi	B-GPE
armed	O
forces	O
is	O
the	O
change	O
has	O
to	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
.	O

It	O
does	O
n't	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
up	O
.	O

You	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
ground	O
commanders	O
calling	O
back	O
and	O
saying	O
hey	O
,	O
we	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
try	O
this	O
tactic	O
or	O
this	O
seems	O
to	O
work	O
.	O

Tell	O
everybody	O
else	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
.	O

Instead	O
the	O
high	O
command	O
has	O
to	O
identify	O
a	O
problem	O
,	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
solution	O
and	O
transmit	O
it	O
down	O
.	O

Chances	O
are	O
the	O
Iraqis	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
stick	O
with	O
what	O
we	O
've	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
irregular	O
forces	O
blending	O
in	O
with	O
civilians	O
trying	O
to	O
attack	O
U.S.	B-GPE
forces	O
,	O
some	O
more	O
of	O
these	O
suicide	O

which	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
problematic	O
for	O
our	O

There	O
's	O
no	O
way	O
around	O
that	O
but	O
U.S.	B-GPE

,	O

are	O
beginning	O
to	O
adapt	O

WOODRUFF	B-PER
I	O
want	O
to	O
ask	O
you	O
about	O
you	O
mentioned	O
coalition	O
forces	O
going	O
in	O
expecting	O
more	O
support	O
from	O
ordinary	O
Iraqi	B-GPE
people	O
.	O

I	O
just	O
interviewed	O
a	O
gentleman	O
,	O
native	O
of	O
Iraq	B-GPE
,	O
who	O
talks	O
to	O
his	O
family	O
there	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
and	O
he	O
says	O
they	O
live	O
in	O
Baghdad	B-GPE
20	O
,	O
30	O
,	O
50	O
of	O
them	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
view	O
the	O
Americans	O
as	O
invaders	O
.	O

They	O
hate	O
Saddam	B-PER
Hussein	I-PER
.	O

They	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
what	O
he	O
's	O
doing	O
but	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
the	O
Americans	O
are	O
the	O
answer	O
.	O

POLLACK	B-PER
All	O
right	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
we	O
've	O
been	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
grip	O
on	O
for	O
years	O
,	O
exactly	O
what	O
the	O
Iraqi	B-GPE
people	O
feel	O
and	O
also	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
best	O
evidence	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
the	O
attack	O
began	O
was	O
that	O
Iraqis	O
do	O
,	O
they	O
despise	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
desperate	O
to	O
be	O
rid	O
of	O
him	O
but	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
token	O
,	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
another	O
country	O
coming	O
into	O
their	O
country	O
to	O
overturn	O
the	O
government	O
and	O
beyond	O
that	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
probably	O
most	O
important	O
for	O
most	O
Iraqis	O
is	O
they	O
're	O
deeply	O
suspicious	O
of	O
the	B-GPE
United	I-GPE
States	I-GPE
.	O

They	O
remember	O
that	O
the	B-GPE
United	I-GPE
States	I-GPE
betrayed	O
them	O
in	O
1991	O
.	O

The	B-GPE
U.S.	I-GPE
did	O
n't	O
finish	O
Saddam	B-PER
then	O
.	O

President	B-PER
Bush	I-PER

then	O
President	B-PER
Bush	I-PER
called	O
on	O
them	O
to	O
rise	O
up	O
and	O
then	O
the	B-GPE
U.S.	I-GPE
did	O
nothing	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
're	O
deeply	O
suspicious	O
of	O
what	O
we	O

in	O

going	O

One	O
last	O
thing	O
,	O
Ken	B-PER
Pollack	I-PER
I	O
want	O
to	O
ask	O
about	O
this	O
British	B-GPE
officials	O
saying	O
that	O

have	O
information	O
that	O
Saddam	B-PER
Hussein	I-PER
has	O
fired	O

What	O
's	O
the	O
significance	O
of	O
that	O
?	O

POLLACK	B-PER
Well	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
true	O
and	O
obviously	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
just	O
yet	O
but	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
true	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
significant	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
effectively	O
the	O
Iraqis	O
admitting	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
civilian	O
casualties	O
that	O
we	O
've	O
seen	O
over	O
the	O

where	O
the	B-GPE

is	O
in	O

?	O

KUBBA	B-PER
Well	O
,	O
one	O
needs	O
to	O
break	O
down	O
this	O
process	O
into	O
various	O
elements	O
.	O

Today	O
,	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
an	O
authority	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
likely	O
that	O
the	B-GPE
U.S.	I-GPE
and	O
the	O
British	B-GPE
forces	O
are	O
the	O
authority	O
on	O
land	O
.	O

And	O
there	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
administration	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
primarily	O
by	O
Iraqis	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
government	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
really	O
need	O
to	O
map	O
out	O
step	O
by	O
step	O
how	O
to	O
move	O
from	O
this	O
power	O
vacuum	O
to	O
the	O

we	O

forces	O
in	O

outside	O

But	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
quickly	O
,	O
because	O
every	O
day	O
passes	O
by	O
with	O
this	O

it	O

he	O

the	O

up	O

examines	O
his	O

then	O
checks	O
his	O

Finally	O

the	O

he	O
