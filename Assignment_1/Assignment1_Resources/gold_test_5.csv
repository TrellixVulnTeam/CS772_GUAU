1818,Poor quality.  Tore while trying to peel them off their backing. For petite hands only with thin nails only.,1
1822,Pattern was cute and nice that they came with the application but they literally lasted 2 hours if that. The adhesive needs work for sure!,1

2357,Have used it much.  Used it for two weeks saw no results so I discontinued the use.,1
2360,You should be able to pick zero stars if that is your opinion. This did nothing for me after almost 2 months of use.,1
2374,not working for me at all after one full bottom use.  make no different for me.,1
2385,"made my eyes swell up, burns and hurts very badly.",1

2522,It's suppose be a professional flatiron however it didn't get my natural kinks out like I had hoped.,1
2573,lace flares outward and does not fall against face as pictured. Had to cut the lace off to make it decent looking for my Halloween costume.,1
2578,These ears are HUGE!!! Like abnormally large.. and they quality isn't the best either.,1
2589,Not what I expected. I would not put my shears in here.,1

2644,Very cheap product. Did not work- don't buy!. Overly priced!,1
2648,Are not silicone as advertised. They do not fit any eyelash curlers I have.,1
2650,"This looks cool when new but, the silver washes away, then it starts peeling off like sun burnt skin. Disappointed!",1
2655,I cancel my order and yal still charge my account.,1
2682,It did not meet expectations. It's a bit weak when it comes to removing the tough spots around the big toe.,1
2720,After taking this for several months I can not tell any difference at all in my skin.,1
2722,thought it had 350mgs of phytoceramide but only had 40:(,1
2729,Left a gooey mess in my hair. I will not be using this again :(,1
2740,Straight out of the box it didn't work :-(,1
2742,"This apron is for a child, and I purchased 4 , totally waste my money , only putting a star because it is required !!!",1
2743,Was not happy with this I returned it. Cheap material and to short,1
2745,It only covers one boob and doesn't go past the tops of my thighs... wish I'd have known this was a kids apron,1
2748,"Item not as described, apron could fit a small child. My shirt was longer than this",1
2749,Apron arrived quickly but was super small like it was perfect for kids and not an adult.,1
2750,The neckline is too short.  Feels uncomfortable.  Like they fit a kid.  And I'm kinda small.  5 feet 120 lbs.,1
2751,Not working ... total money wasted on Heater as well as this wax kit.,1
2758,"This is absolutely useless, does not work.  I actually need to return it.",1
2772,Don't like it. It says waterproof and Matt. It's not Matt it's shiny finish.,1
2779,A week after it expanded and leaked out of the jar leaving my shelves stained..,1
2781,what is this shock of the size please refund my money bad texture my eyes hurts when upply,1
2783,"Didn't work at all, I needed it to help regrow parts of my eye brows and eyelashes but nothing happened.",1
2803,I tried it off and on for 6 weeks and every time it triggered a migraine for me.,1
2804,"It did not work for me or my husband.  Also, very overpriced for such a small container.",1
2805,"wheres the Sugar-Free? Stevia is gross, make a Sugar Free line.",1
2810,"I love that this is organic but I surely did not like the taste.  Also, it didn't seem to help with me sleeping anybetter.",1
2813,up most of the night with this product...not a good experience,1
2817,Not a good product at all. Very bad taste and does not help for nothing. Makes you irritated,1
2827,"Maybe this stuff wakes you up, but it tastes disgusting. I just can't stomach it",1
2828,This product gave me a headache and made me feel lightheaded.  I will not use again!,1
2850,Only used it three times and the tip broke. Disappointing.,1
2852,"It broke very quickly. But was alright when it lasted. It did not gather much hair, therefore it took a little longer to dread.",1
2853,"Its useless, the tip is small like a needle point..",1
2854,This is d tool i received 1 of.... And your add shows 2...,1
2855,When I got this product it wasn't what is in the picture. I received a afro pick looking item. I am very upset.,1
2856,Repetitive and the reviewed tells prospective customers to buy more than one. Too many 5 star given next to manufactured words.. had to say something.,1
2864,It was very inferior to the model I replaced.  I found the unit to be flimsy and certainly not to  the quality I expected.,1
2867,It worked for a month and then stopped pumping out water,1
2875,"Not working at all... Not matching the color of the skin for me and for my friends, not covering at all...",1
2878,Does not cover your tattoo! Expensive and you get 4 little squares!!! Crap!!!,1
2879,Says it was delivered today. But it was not in the box?!?,1
2880,No stars band-aid bandages work better no need to waste your money.,1
2881,Might as well buy a bandaid. This item fell off easily too.,1
2882,the TAPE didn't stay on for 30 minutes! better off using a band aid,1
2884,Have to use several in order to cover a light tattoo and it is pretty noticeable,1
2885,needed it for wedding day to cover underarm spots due to a problem and it looked hidious,1
2886,The material is SHEER. Does not cover a tattoo whatsoever. The edges don't stay stuck to the skin. A plain bandaid/bandage looks less ridiculous.,1
2887,If you actually need to cover a tattoo this product is not for you. Tattoo on my hand completely showed through.,1
2891,This product didn't cover my tattoo at all. Had to use almost the whole pack for 1 application,1
2892,Very misleading but works for wounds not for covering a tattoo.,1
2894,These looked worse than a bandaid! It made your skin look dry and flakey and had a weird color to it,1
2898,"It only lasts for 1 week. However, the one I bought in Japan lasted for 3 months. I am very upset by this Amazon seller.",1
2905,IT IS WAY TO DARK.  THE COTTON BALL OR  BRUSH DOES NOT DO THE TRICK.  CALIFORNIA SUN IS 100% BETTER.,1
2910,"I ordered this item,but the incorrect item of heart vitimin came. I have return that item;however where is my Indian Earth-2gram with puff?",1
2918,It's too dark I thought it was more tan or bronze definitely I didn't like it ,1
2920,Not the original. Much smaller and container is different.,1
2932,"Perhaps my.memory fails me, but this product doesn't seem to be the same.product I remember. Does anyone else have an opinion on this?",1
2935,I did not like it ..it was too dark and it did not look natural,1
2941,this powder is VERY dark!  I have olive skin and have a great tan--It is difficult to put on --,1
2955,Very hard to get on evenly.  I finally just threw it away.,1
2956,Very disappointed !!! Nothing like the original Indian earth. This is absolutely ORANGE!,1
2970,They were not as all as I had pictured.  They were very tight and very short in length.  My husband could not wear them.,1
2971,These sock are not xxl.  They do not fit a man's size 13.  They will not return or refund.  Very disappointed.,1
2976,XXLarge were too small for a man who wears 13 and 1/2 size shoes.,1
2989,"Ripping at all seems, must hand wash or it will rip",1
3004,Tiny one size if you are bigger than a size 10 or large C or D cup don't bother.,1
3014,I like the soap itself but the scent well its just not for me..my husband said I smelt like a grandma :(,1
3019,"While I think this product is fantastic and smells wonderful, I can only give one star because it's over priced compared to other sites",1
3037,Dies not work . Bought this product to use for my inner thighs,1
3042,"Doesn't live up to it's claims.  In effect, it is useless.",1
3044,Does not work.  I used as instructed on the container and it made absolutely no difference,1
3045,"Save your money, don't bother with this product.  Absolutely no change after use of entire bottle.  Will not purchase again.",1
3046,"It has a bad smell and I use two bottles in one month and I didn't see any difference ...

I didn't like it at all..",1
3047,This did not work at all. Have been using for 6 months. Waste of money,1
3049,Hasn't worked yet and it's been a month...,1
3050,After 2 weeks. No difference. Doesn't work for everyone.,1
3051,I have not seen any results !! It's been over 2 weeks !! Very disappointed !,1
3053,It does not whiten. Its just lotion! what a scam!,1
3057,Doesn't work at all used for a month no results!,1
3058,Terrible product does not work I've ordered 2 for my wife and she has seen no results,1
3059,I've tried it for a month and doesn't do much,1
3062,Not what I expected.  It actually dried out my hands and I have stopped using it.,1
3063,It did the opposite. Created darker pigmentation on areas after using the lotion. Very unhappy with product. Stopped using it completely.,1
3064,Over a month & still nothing. I used as directed. Will try another product,1
3065,This doesn't work. I followed the directions and waited several weeks for a hint of lightning. None whatsoever. Save your money.,1
3069,Bought with high hopes. It's been a month and nothing wish there were 0 stars,1
3071,I received this product a month ago. I am Hispanic and this cream doesn't work at all for my olive-white skin.,1
3073,I've used this once and figured there was no need for it anymore. Not sure why i fell for this gimmick.,1
3078,"I bought it twice and I didn't see no improvement, your better off saving your money and using home remedies such as lemon and baking soda",1
3082,It does not work very fast it needs time I guess that's why I didn't like it,1
3084,Bottle too small no enough to tell a difference...but I enjoyed the moisturizing properties.,1
3086,Used twice a day for seven weeks. No change. No fading at all. Does not do anything.,1
3088,Didn't work and smells funny too. Would not recommend.. Don't waste your money.,1
3090,I've been using this twice a day everyday on my armpits and have seen no results. I am really disappointed.,1
3091,Didn't work at all. Don't waste your money.,1
3093,Used this for a scar and it didn't work. All previous reviews must have been fake,1
3100,"I bought 2 bottles, I'm almost done with the first one but don't see any result yet",1
3111,Awful. Looks like a small donut with the hole in the center. I wasted my $$ on this.,1
3118,These reviews must be fake. This loofah does not distribute soap well at all.,1
3144,It fell apart before I could even put it on. It was super-glued very tacky. A horrible job really.,1
3147,this item was made poorly. I had to replace the chains and clasp. not to mention it did not come with the ring,1
3150,Item broke within seconds of taking it out of package.,1
3153,It's not worth your wait or anticipation.  The ring is worthless and the length is shorter than it shows here on the arm.,1
3155,Not what i thought it was. Only one piece! The ring was not glued to the rose. Very disappointed.,1
3156,Item is cheaply made and the flower was busted off of the metal when it arrived.,1
3160,"Bad quality, the clasp is broken and there are not as many beads like in the picture. Want a refund.",1
3163,piece missing or somethng doesn't attach to finger it looks cheap,1
3168,"Arrived broken, ring was separated and decoration beads on top were off. Cheaply made. Never got to wear item.",1
3189,Horrible. Blades don't cut worth a toot and hair just goes between the two blades instead of cutting. Not worth the annoyance or expense.,1
3202,Not sharp. You had one job scissors. You didn't do it.,1
3214,Very cheap.  They broke the first time I used them and did not cut cleanly.,1
3218,Uncomfortable in the first night and my ear still hurt. I guess it works for some and not for others. Will try again,1
3220,"Way too large in diameter, too thick and too firm,  awkward and uncomfortable.",1
3221,"I was very disappointed with this product. Not comfortable to use while sleeping. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it.",1
3222,It is too thick to sleep on.  I even cut it in half but was still uncomfortable.  I don't recommend this.,1
3224,"Too large, wish they were not so tall and half the size.  Not what I was looking for.",1
3229,"I could not figure out how to use this product so, for me, it was a waste of money",1
3232,"This ear pillow came without a cover, or an offer to sell one. It was too high and caused my neck to hurt.",1
3235,Didn't mean to star this useless product. It hurt my ear and is impossible to lie on. Surely there's a better solution!,1
3242,I can't even give this thing any stars. It came to me broken!!!!,1
3269,I hate these things. They don't snap together and the halo part falls off each time you remove a wig from the stand. So annoying.,1
3276,Product had leaked inside the original packaging -defective. See image. Can't believe this was sent!!,1
3282,Mirror is not fog free. No better than any other shower mirror on the market.,1
3286,Would like it if it did not leak like crazy.,1
3288,This is like glue on your lips. It's awful!,1
3291,This stuff sucks. Drys lips and starts to cracking and flake off.,1
3323,No manual came with it so I don't know how to use it.,1
3324,"Hated. Way too big, captured way too much of the skin around my mouth. Bad suction",1
3328,Garbage!! And tastes like you're eating plastic when you try to use it.,1
3332,To big for mouth. Doesn't fit. Waste of $7.,1
3333,It's just the worst thing I ever purchased on Amazon it doesn't fit at all very poor Construction,1
3334,"Pure junk. All vinyl,  no strength or pressure,  just makes you open your mouth wide.",1
3342,"When I put it on, can't close my mouth",1
3354,Order this and high hopes. It's been over 3 weeks and my lashes look exactly the same.  Lesson learned,1
3360,I see no changes i do't know how many more i need to buy.,1
3361,It really does not work. I took before and after pictures no difference. The product is a very tiny size too! Don't waste your money,1
3364,Was fine. But nothing like Careprost  (generic latisse ) only $25 from [...],1
3391,These do not work the same as the originals very disappointed,1
3397,These are NOT worth the money. They are cheaply made and the bristles fall out easily! I went back to my regular brush.,1
3398,Not any better than something you could get at the dollar store. Made no difference in my nails.,1
3407,Horrible. Breaks every pencil I put in there. Not recommended,1
3413,Stupid small logo in corner makes them useless for ccg like magic or anything with text,1
3429,If I could I'd give it no starts. Slipped right out the same night I put it on!! Horrible waste of money.,1
3431,"I didn't like this product at all, I found it sticky and it didn't do anything helpful.",1
3434,these are super tiny and tried to send them back and kept getting the run around. So I have items I could not return. Would not recommend,1
3438,I ended up having to throw all of these away. As I was pouring the deodorant base it all leaked out through the bottom.,1
3478,This was misrepresented. I thought it was an adult bag but it was small and plastic. Very disappointed.,1
3479,No so stable. It was a great idea but it's too flimsy and doesn't hold without flopping around.,1
3481,"This is very tiny, crappy and smells funny. Not even close to the dimensions provided.",1
3502,Not impressed.  Cheaply made--don't waste your money,1
3510,Way smaller than I expected. I can only fit some f my make up in this baby bag.,1
3519,"These lip liners are very dry, and don't stay on well...I wish I could return them!",1
3532,My package got lost. So I can't comment.,1
3539,"Awful, poor quality. Colors do not match pictured/advertised colors at all.",1
3553,I ordered lip liners and I received colored pens!!! I am furious.,1
3559,A number of my liners were completely crushed when I opened the package,1
3562,"These lip colors all look the same, there was no variety and the color doesn't draw on smoothly.",1
3571,"the color variety is good, but it goes on choppy, not smoothly.",1
3582,"Great price, disappointing variety. Looks different in box but 75% of the pencils are some variation of mauve",1
3584,I didn't get my lip liner today and so disappointed thank you,1
3586,When applied the colors don't show great colors.  Product was dry when applied on lips. Waste of money.,1
3599,"Most colors very similar, drying, not very creamy so hard to apply. Meh.",1
3601,"Smears really bad, doesn't stay on at all.",1
3619,"I got the wrong product, I got the Me Now lip/eye liner rather than the italia",1
3632,Crap quality. Colors listed on outside do not match actual color,1
3633,I did not receive Italia product....it was a bait and switch. I received a different brand and the colors don't match.,1
3642,I'm a caramel skin tone and these don't really show on my skin tone.,1
3658,The colors are very smudgy .... bad quality....,1
3666,Read somewhere it's made in USA. Nope. Made in China !!,1
3692,I used only ones and I had irritation and burning.  I never use this product again.,1
3704,It is definitely not long lasting. It smudges off super quick.,1
3748,You get waht you pay for. Strong chemical smell and taste. Wears off momentarily.,1
3822,got a rash and cold sores on lips after use!  DO not USE - crapppy product and not healthy!,1
3871,Uhh like all the same colors! Feel like they are fake pencils hardly shows up when you apply and smears really easy!,1
3924,The quality is good. I would give more stars but I only received 11 pencils and out of those 11 one came without a lid.,1
4102,I didn't get a chance to try the lipliners but they seem like a good product,1
4136,"These came in pretty quickly, I just received them. However, 7 of the pencils are shorter than the other 5. Will be returning.",1
4184,Smells like actual cat pee. Very weird and doesn't work very well.,1
4185,This didn't work at all. All it did was severely dry out my skin and look patchy under my foundation,1
4188,It stinks.  It's brown.  It's ineffective.,1
4196,I have no idea why this product has good reviews. This product has not improved my acne over the course of 2 days.,1
4204,I've had it for only a month and it's already starting to flicker.  It is not a longevity product.,1
4214,"Loved the idea but after a few hours, I was still musty smelling. Dit Pitt paste is cheaper than this product.",1
4224,"Seemed like different ingredients used, as this product has not worked for me, as it had in the past.",1
4232,Hoping to find an alternate deodorant with natural ingredients. Tried it. Didn't work. Would like to find something that does.,1
4235,My girlfriend tried using this and she smelled like old meat.  Not sexy.,1
4244,This product is terrible. It doesn't work at all and the seller won't offer returns or refunds. Big waste of money.,1
4246,Did not work for me. Armpits stank by mid-day.,1
4254,It doesn nothing u just smell horrible. Barely one star.,1
4260,Think this made me smell more and faster than just not using any deodorant.,1
4263,Tried this product multiple times and types and always end up with burns under my arms. Give up.,1
4274,I guess it's not for me. It made my armpits have a dark cast and itchy,1
4275,Rediculously small amount of product for the price. Wont buy this again.,1
4314,this opulent did not work for me. It made my under eye darker.,1
4323,This product is HORRIBLE...absolutely unwearable. It's down right disgusting! I have never used a lip product that cakes on lips like this.,1
4327,it doesn't look the same color of the picture.,1
4328,The product is very flaky compared to other liquid lipsticks. I am not a fan.,1
4330,It felt like I had smeared clay all over my lips. Never buying this product again!,1
4339,Yes it does stay on but it cracks and it becomes clumpy once you eat or drink something,1
4363,I was ordering an ECO brush. When it was delivered I was surprised to see a different brand the bristles were too soft,1
4368,Hand cream was nice but it had way too much fragrance for me. Gave it to a friend who loves it.,1

7580,The clip didn't open properly. The closing clasp won't move. It is not a good buy unfortunately,1
7583,This was one of the most useless products I have bought.  It wouldn't stay in her hair so I could cut it.,1

7915,You can tell this is not real jade just by looking it. See how the light bounces off? Its plastic people.,1

7995,"hard to understand how to use, instructions hard to read",1
7996,Maybe its just me? I cant do it! My hair is so thick it doesnt fit,1
8005,The product works ok..the problem is when I tranfered the sunscreen into 3oz travel bottles the 2nd one was 1/3 full.. Not 6oz..maybe 4.5 at the most,1
8011,"The loofa would be great, but it is tiny!",1
8025,I was expecting 2. Only received 1.. Now I have to wait longer.,1
8036,The nob at the bottom gets stuck in my hair!,1
8038,"Awful! They rip out my hair, do not glide at all, and are cheap. Do not waste a dime on these garbage pins.",1
8054,"Was like jello in a tube, lid popped off, and it made my lips bleed",1

8065,"Its not long lasting at all, once you drink or eat , it just disappear",1
8066,It wasn't a rich red like the advertisements show. Also would horribly stain my teeth.,1
8071,"Shipping took like a month and it does not work good, it doesnt stay that long, it taste nasty, you're better  off buying a lipstain",1
8078,I can eat a red tootsie pop and have the same effect.,1
8080,"very bad product

8207,"After using this foam, my face is full of rash. Be careful when buy this product.",1
8220,Don't like it. It stays on the skin feeling sticky. Won't soak in. I want my money back.,1

8298,Didn't meet my expectations. Pulled my hair out. Hair got stuck and it didn't work like it said it would. Would not recommend,1
8299,Every time I used it my hair got stock on it even with a small piece of hair,1
8300,Do not buy this.  It broke on the first use.,1
8306,It is not easy to use. It constantly pulls your hair when trying to use it. Will not use again.,1
8308,This will pull your hair out of your head!  Wouldn't recommend this anyone!,1
8312,It didn't worked like I thought it would. It actually pulled out clumps of my hair.,1

No visual difference. Period.",1
8349,In the picture it shows to the floor but what I got does not even touch the clients knees very disappointed,1

8357,This is a joke! Not like in the pic at all very cheap material,1
8371,Smelled like beeswax and did not see much improvement for the price.  Look further.,1
8383,It doesn't work on me but it doesn't mean won't work on others because every body  is different,1

8406,No difference in lashes. Gave me a terrible rash on my eyelids.,1
8407,I had a reaction to it. Doesn't mean it doesn't work,1
8410,This doesn't seem to do anything to my lashes. I wouldn't recommend it.,1
8412,"Product did not work at it says, no change what so ever.",1
8413,"I used this nightly but have never seen any improvement in my lashes. I was very disappointed, especially for the cost.",1
8415,"I've been applying for the past 14 days, and still don't see any real difference as of yet. I will continue to apply",1
8418,This product doesn't work! And it burns horribly. Why create a product you apply to your eyelashes that burns your eyes?,1
8419,"I applied it for over a month, and had no luck with it. My lashes didn't get thicker nor longer.",1
8420,This did not work for me. I prefer rapid lash.,1
8421,This is snake oil and does nothing to help your lashes grow.,1
8425,It seems impossible to keep out of my eye and it burns. I haven't been able to use it enough to tell a difference.,1
8427,"Been using for almost 2 months, I don't see much growth. I won't buy this again.",1
8431,Didn't work and made my eyes burn when it dripped down. Not worth the risk to my eyes.,1

8452,I've been using this twice a day for almost two months and there is no difference,1
8464,Did not do anything. NOT EFFECTIVE AT ALL!!! So Guys don't even bother  it's a waste of your money.,1
8465,I used it a few weeks every night and saw no changes.,1
8467,Unfortunately I had to return it after 3 nights of use. This product was burning my eyes and causing me bad head ache in the morning.,1
8472,Didn't work at all. Don't waste your money on this product,1
8473,Absolutely Awful!!! It irritated my eyes so bad they have not stopped watering 52 hours later.... This is so horrible!!,1
8477,This product doesn't seem to work as well as others I have tried.  Will not order again.,1
8479,I have 1 month using this and i have not seen any result,1
8492,"No results! I have had this product for ove 3 weeks and the only thing that has happened is that my eyelashes are falling!

8507,Been using this religiously. Nothing happened. Waste of my time and money.,1
8510,Doesn't work .I've been using it for over two week's and no difference in my eyelashes. Disappointed: (,1

8523,Have not seen any difference yet when I ask my daughter what she think s she said not yet,1
8529,I really wish it was working but do not see any improvement.  I have followed the directions as directed.,1

8553,This burned my eyes and in the two days I used it lashes were falling out.,1
8555,Can't see any difference.  It's pretty pricey for the tiny bottle.,1
8559,"Unfortunately, this product stung my eyes the first time I tried to use it, so I had to return it.",1
8560,Sadly this growth serum did the reverse. It burned my eyes and caused eyelash loss. Glad it works for some people but not me.,1
8564,Does not work! I've been using it for almost a month and no difference in lashes.,1
8568,Eyelashes fell out and it burned my eyes so I returned it.,1
8572,They're so very thin. I'm so sad. I had no idea.,1
8573,"No where near as light as in the picture, with copper and black strands throughout the hair. Much thinner than expected.",1
8574,Not even close to real hair or double weft. So thin and straw like feeling. Returning asap. Very upset,1
8578,Super thin and inconsistent broken hair folicals and split ends. Really disappointed in the amount of shedding as well,1
8579,Extremely thick at the clips & straggly at the ends. NOT worth the price,1
8580,These are NOt 13 inches! Try 11 and really thin at the ends.,1
8582,I would put 0 but it makes me put a star. Went to curl the hair and it BURNT!!! Not good.,1
8583,Absolutely horrible. This stringy tons of breakage...also missing small piece and clips coming off off hair. Also 2 to 3 inches shorter than advertised,1
8584,This is more like 60grm not a 105g not happy at all. Waste of my money.,1
8585,Don't buy these unless you have very thin hair. 110g is not enough for a full head of medium/thick hair.,1
8587,"Not worth the money! Each extension does not have enough hair, so your natural hair is pretty visible with just some long strings of hair falling.",1
8588,Worst quality ever. Wish I could get my money back. After less than a week of wear they look like a synthetic Halloween witch wig.,1
8593,"Horrible DONT BUY THESE, their super thin, and shed a lot",1
8602,I do hair and These extensions are horrible. Don't waste your time. Spend a little more and get better ones.,1
8604,"This hair is very thin, I would buy other extensions. I was very ddisappointed",1
8622,Did not work...used as directed and still didn't work!,1
8627,"Arrived as a bottle of solid, dry, white rubber.  Unusable.",1
8629,I thought these were universal but they did not work on any of my doterra bottles or other bottles I had.... very disappointed,1
8640,Within 2 weeks all the pumps on the four we ordered stuck and would not operate.,1
8646,The colors are very pretty and vibrant. The reason for only one star is because it starts chipping after 2-3 days.,1
8653,Too small in length as well as diameter.  Useless.,1
8659,not as good as other I had bought in store. unravels.,1
8665,It's been 1 years since I use this cream I don't see any results yet and it burn a lot smh ,1
8669,This looks like a total nighty. Something a grandma would wear to bed. Looks way cuter in the picture!,1
8682,My head broke out and my hair had no improvement.,1
8683,I question that these were new bottles.  No box for them and appeared to be used,1
8685,Colors were soooo ugly i have thick hair and already ripped one of the scrunchiess.. 10 dollars for 5 generic rubber bands and faux fur .. hell nooo,1
8686,The fuzz it wrapped around the elastic as suppose to being fed through it. When u stretch it out the elastic is exposed.,1
8687,These didn't come in the cute colors shown... I got bright red ones and lime green. Ugly colors. False advertising.,1
8725,"Sort of eucalyptus oil smell, but not very nice.  It works for our purposes, but we'll be looking for a better/nicer product.",1
8726,Arrived with the dropper broken and the aroma smells awful and nothing like eucalyptus,1
8729,This smells like no other eucalyptus oil I've ever tried. It's actually nauseating if you know what it's supposed to smell like,1
8731,"Smell is very overpowering and smells nothing like eucalyptus oils I have had in the past. Bought it to use in the sauna, would NOT recommend.",1
8738,"Cute, but It broke within a week of wearing, I'm very disappointed. I wouldn't waste your money like I did.",1
8741,Do not put this in your body. Do not buy this.,1
8742,Broke after a few days. Husband fixed and it fell back apart days later. Bad quality,1
8770,"Worked great at first now doesn't work at all .
.",1
8774,"Extremely disappointed, this is not the product I have used in the past. Will never buy from this company again.",1
8776,I would like to return.  Too difficult to use.  Thought it was would much more simple.,1
8778,Didn't like it and it didn't work for me at all. Big disappointment!,1
8795,With the first use of this guard one of the teeth broke off.,1
8802,"Stupid, waste of money. Do physical exercises instead, its free and will yield in better results.",1
8807,The springs fell out just not worth buying get the real thing,1
8808,it heared my nose  it made me get red nose and apipple  a whight pipple on it and it heard,1
8809,Bought these for my 14 year old daughter. She says they hurt really bad when she wears them.,1
8811,"It is too tight, getting pain when i am wearing it",1
8818,Thought I would give these a try instead of a real piercing but they hurt to bad to wear,1
8819,These are WAY too big to be a nose piercing. They're bulky and stick out too much. Would not buy again.,1
8820,Really disapointed they are different from pictures and they ar in wierd sizes,1
8822,its to big for nose and does not looks good !!!,1
8824,The only problem with this product is that it leaves sores on your nose and it hurts to pull it off,1
8825,It made a hole in my nose! I went to the docter to get it checked out tho.,1
8834,They're WAY TO BIG  was expecting that and very upset about bit .,1
8843,I don't like them @ all they was too little,1
8844,Got one colored one the rest gold. Shopping took forever. Not worth it.,1
8850,It was too watery for my liking and it was choppy never applied good on the nails,1
8852,Disappointed!!! This gel nail polish only lasted me two days.,1
8856,Not so great. Peeled up after the 1st 24 hours.,1
8858,The colors are no where near the same as picture shown.,1
8860,This took forever to get and then when I got it the color was not how it shows in the picture NOT WORTH THE WAIT,1
8861,I bought this specifically for the white and yet somehow I have grey instead! ,1
8865,Don't let this TINY bottle fool you! There is even LESS product inside. It's probably about a quarter of the way full....,1
8870,"Not gel. Regular pain. Scam. Dont buy. Check photo for next day after application, and yes I usef an UV light",1
8873,Box came Open and a nail Polish was split all over it's fake don't buy,1
8875,It's definitely not a prime item. SHIPMENT WILL TAKE more than 2 months to the US.,1
8879,Polish was goopy and would not coat properly. Very disappointing.,1
8880,Disappointed that the white didn't come and that was the reason I chose this set,1
8881,The product description was inaccurate as the colors do not match the pictures. Besides the white all the colors were nearly the same shade of pink.,1
8883,Colors are watered down. I had to apply several coats to get desired coverage. Not happy with the purchase. What a waste!,1
8885,Bad quality. Too thick and doesn't go well on the nails.,1
8887,I hate this so much! The top coat doesnt cure at all! I tried for 10 minutes and it was just a sticky liquid mess.,1
8890,I have not been successful with curing this top and base coat with a UV light,1
8891,"Ive had good luck with this brand in the past, but the colors shown are not what I received.all pastel/neon, and almost translucent.",1
8903,This product is horrible.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  It doesn't deserve 1 star.,1
8906,Came in Time it was supposed to but only one of the colors was close to correct from my order very disappointed,1
8913,Very poor product. It does not dry with the UV light. Don't waste your money,1
8914,It seemed like the product was fried up and one was damaged upon it's arrival,1
8916,"I took over 5 coats just to get a color pay off, it was rather streaky too.",1
8933,This is crazy. How can you expect a feet back after one days use ,1
8936,"Not impressed :(
Another one bites th' dust.",1
8941,Came chunky and separated. I'm returning it. Too bad I have to go through the hassle of returning. Should be able to just toss it,1
8942,This stuff sucks.  Was all clumpy and separated and didn't shrink or blur my pores at all.  Actually made my skin look worse!,1
8943,This was not usable. It was separated. Liquid just poured out of the container. Do not buy this it is a waste of money,1
8947,Must be expired. Not the correct texture. I have bought from store before and know what the texture should be like.,1
8950,this product came an was goopy and watery  I would not recommend it!,1
8951,"As many others said, both of the products were separated so when you try to squeeze it out you get a big liquidy mess. Very dissappointed.",1
8998,"Does not last.  I had it for 10 days, and it was already worn smooth on both sides.  I would not waste my money.",1
9009,Did not do what I expected.  Not worth the money.,1
9013,"I got this belly ring and the next day, the tassels broke off. Quality was horrible",1

Very heavy and slippery!",1
9037,Looks better in picture something I would not wear but I let my 5 year old niece wear it,1

9059,It was a kinda cute for a minute..then it broke.,1

9063,I'm not sure what this is made out of...it turned a greenish color after an hour of wear,1
9066,"It broke the first day I wore it. Can't expect too much at that price, I guess. The strands kept getting tangled as well.",1
9068,Broke as soon as I tried to get on :-),1
9070,It's pretty but it didn't last long worn one time it broke,1
9075,necklace was assembled wrong. Had to take it apart and had to reassemble it so it would look as pictured. Was not expecting that.,1
9077,Threw it away after weari it 2 days. The shiny metal changed color and turned brown. Don't bother...,1
9080,"Nothing like the picture. Also it's really cheap, one small tug would probably break the chain.",1
9102,does nothin to urn fat. It is uncomfortable and you don't really feel the fat burning,1
9103,It hurt when you remove it from your skin its just feel like a plaster and i didn't feel any change in the skjn texture or fat reduction,1
9106,Painful to take off didn't see any change . DON'T buy this wasted my money.,1

9144,Does not work at all. Does absolutely nothing!!,1
9145,It hurts when u take it off. Sending it back!,1
9147,Please pay attention to the reviews! The only negative reviews are verified purchases. The rest are not to be trusted!,1
9156,Not what i expected.  It was more like thinly sliced duct tape,1
9157,"horrible , horrible, horrible quality! The only reason why i put (1) star is because there isn't an option to select ""none""",1
9162,"Junk.  only 3 of them worked initially, and all stopped after about a week.",1
9163,I bought 4 of these and with in 2 weeks they all stopped working,1
9165,They don't work. Contents come out between top and bottle and not through the pump.,1
9191,OMG! This was so oily and messy.  I returned it.,1
9197,Very cheaply made. The stamp etchings are not deep enough to gather polish to actually stamp.,1
9198,I just got my order and im missing the pink stamper and my stamping plate! I want the rest of my order!!!!,1
9208,The light is too bright so it blinds you when you're trying to use it,1

9248,I am sorry I am not at all happy with this it didn't remove or fade my dark spot.,1
9249,Did not work at all and I gave it at least a month. Very disappointed and feel like I was taken advantage of and given false hope.,1
9251,I've using this product for over four weeks. I have yet to see any results. It's not worth the price.,1
9261,While these are 10ml bottles.they are not standard diameter and are not interchangeable with other bottles of same capacity. Will not use this company again.,1
9263,This wax smells horrible!  I can't use it!  Cosmetic grade?  I think not!,1
9282,No stars. The hair can not be heated and is plastic,1
9283,Terrible quality. Looks like plastic Barbie hair. The halo band is huge and non adjustable so it skips and slides,1
9288,"Every review here was given the product free for their ""honest opinion"" of the product. How about hearing from someone who didn't get bribed.",1
9295,These suck. Don't waste your time. It was a total waste of money.,1
9298,don't waste your money ! its a scam it does not work,1
9306,"the wavey part fell apart and got glue in my hair, in less than 2 weeks.",1
9310,It's OK but it breaks within 2 to 3 weeks of using so if you want to buy a few of them that would be a good choice,1

9338,"Arrived in an envelope uncovered, no instruction, I was almost afraid to use it on my sons hair.",1
9345,Did not easily distribute my tanning mousse. it just absorbed it all. I personally don't know how the large mitt helps smooth things easily.,1
9350,Didn't meet my expectations. Nice smell and nice as a lip gloss but absolutely does not plump lips.,1
9356,"I used the bag, I hung it so it wasn't directly in the water and it still doesn't work. :-(",1
9368,I would say go with cream not powder. Does not blend easy and the no,1

9410,Didnt work and it sucks beacause i really liked the figures. The pictures aren't caved in.,1
9413,It leaves my lips feeling very sticky. Don't buy this if you ever want to kiss anyone!,1
9433,Product is fake. 20$ nock off!! Buy direct from Sephora $45 and worth it.,1
9441,Doesnt seem authentic.  No shimmer and I disliked the smell.  Disappointed.  I returned it,1
9445,This lotion came unsealed...grossed me out was crusty and disgusting I ended up throwing away. I will purchase at Sephora from now on....,1

9600,Bought it for nail stamping. Just isn't thick enough to do the job.,1
9609,These colors look great in the bottle but do not come up nearly as vibrant when stamped over a base color. I would not purchase again.,1
9620,This is really small.... You can't even see it hanging up... So disapointed,1
9622,My key to my car is bigger!  Waste of money,1
9624,No it worked for about a week then it stopped working.,1
9627,This product does not work.  The wire works fine so im still having to charge the phone as always so this is a very expensive cable.,1
9630,"Very slow charger.  This is not worth the money. Just get a spare cable which charges in minutes, not hours.",1
9632,It doesn't charge my phone. Can I get a replacement?,1
9633,This product is the worst it seems like they would sell it at the dollar store,1
9647,Nice looking cleaner but way smaller than 2 liters. Not as advertised.,1
9683,No such thing as described. It wasted my money to try this product.,1

9775,"flimsy as hell. paper thin, didn't even last a day. DON'T BUY",1
9778,I nothing good to about this nail. Shipping took forever and the nail didn't even look like nails. ,1
9780,Poor quality nails. Chip easily and fall off easily. Not worth the cost.,1
9781,"Very poorly made. The tips of the nails bent, and the color rubs off.",1
9782,worst artificial nails that I have ever purchased.  did not stay on.  I purchased them for a special occasion and ended up using something else.,1

9914,"When I received the cream, the top has already opened. Is that mean someone used it before and returned it?",1
9926,This product is a scam. It made the skin around my eyes red and irritated.,1
9929,"This product did NOT work for me at all.  I am so conscious about the bags under my eyes, need help right away.",1
9934,They are not engraved enough so you cannot transfer design on nail :(,1
9942,They are not good for lash extensions.  They are not as sharply precise as I expected them to be.,1
9949,Horrible. The curved tweezers bent & Broke in two pieces (after 2 uses) where it must've been welded.,1
9969,Terrible!  Did not pick up any of the lashes!,1
9983,Ridiculously oversized!!! HUGE earrings. I mean- they go past your shoulder. Not at all what I expected. Tried to return.,1

8,Vacuum underpowered. Good idea but not enough vacuum to drain excess fluid!,2
44,I haven't seen no results yet I use it day and nite nothing,2
113,Not great.  It gives me a headache... probably because it's bee venom.  Plumps just a little.,2
161,Loses the scent with first wash. Disappointed but it is pretty. Just wanted it to have a scent.,2
166,Couldn't get it to hold 30 of my 15ml bottles. Liked it being lightweight but wasn't right for me!,2

211,Shiny but so little . May looks good on a 5 years old!!,2
224,Nice but the color is already changing and it's not even 6 months yet,2

415,"The weft in the front part is bulky, visible, and very hard to hide",2
426,This is that awful $ .25 machine gold color. I wish it wasn't- besides the terrible color it's super cute!,2
427,I ordered this for a 3 day trip to Vegas...which was all it lasted before falling apart. It is cute though.,2
433,Not very secure at least for the use I was attempting which was securing dress straps.,2

500,"Too too fluffy, the loop to hook around button broke in first week.",2
544,Change your picture! I was expecting 2 tubes- as shown.,2

547,"Enh, this primer does nothing for me unfortunately. It didn't blur anything, but it has a nice finish.",2
554,Ears flop down too much. Look more like puppy ears than cat ears,2

1011,too sticky and unpleasant to have on and I don't feel a difference.,2
1031,"Hmmm, not sure if it really works for the purpose",2

1198,Completely knotted in less than a day. Not great quality.,2
1233,Did not work very well at all. Not worth the price.,2
1234,I don't think this product does anything. I am a product junkie and a decent judge of these. Will not buy again.,2
1272,thought it was a charm - but it is just a tiny dragonfly with a tiny poem,2
1287,The charm is exactly that. About 1in and the card is about 2in. A little smaller than expected.,2
1298,"Looks very, very cheap and is HUGE. WAY too big to fit on my head.",2
1324,Doesn't fit my F-5790 razor. Had to return it.,2

1510,"This night cream does not have enough moisture in it.  When I wake up, my skin feels tight and dry.",2
1521,Has a light scent but seems oily. I didn't get the chance to find out if the product worked because it broke out my skin.,2
1540,"not bad, but still nothing impressive, does not worth its price, never more products from this company.",2
1577,The smell is very strong and bothersome. It doesn't feel moisturizing enough.,2
1578,I have very sensitive skin this caused break outs for me.,2
1625,Sadly not the best design. You get what you paid for.,2
1626,they don't exactly look like cat ears when on.. way too triangularly shaped.. just rather awkward.,2
1727,"Cheap, doesn't go all the way around client.",2
1759,"It was not exactly the smell like I had before,  rather not I was expecting. Would not buy again",2
1764,Delivery was great. Great pakaging. But my room smells like a sterile toilet. This is a different lavender scent...,2
1771,Used a few times. It turned my hands darker and the peeling lasted for more than a week each use.  No real noticeable change in color.,2
1812,It gave me a bad rash will never use again to bad i love organic this has never happen to me with anything organic before.,2
1813,All seemed fine the first couple of days and then I developed a really bad rash in the underarm area. Will go back to using Green Tidings.,2
1814,The smell is nice but stained my underarms a little dark.,2
1819,"They're super cute, but annoying to put on. They only work if you have long nails. And they come off easy.",2
1820,Didn't work for me.  Peeled off within two days.,2
1829,You get what you pay for. Cheapest zipper will not close all the way.,2
1851,Cheaply made. Feels like a necklace you get out of a gumball machine...,2
1858,The strings don't go tight enough but otherwise than that you get what you paid for.,2
1860,"Eh its ok , doesnt look that great and the string doesnt go as tight as i wanted.",2
1862,Began unraveling and actually broke within five minutes of wearing it.,2
1896,It is ok don't really like it that you have to take off the back of the phone piece to use. Other than that its ok.,2
1897,Its a nice ring but there's a little down side...the silver coating wore off a half hour after wearing it which was a bummer,2
1905,Pulls my hair out everytime i touch my head. But probably quality commensurate with price,2
1933,Sizing was good. Fit well...but I cannot wear it because it turns my finger green.,2
1953,Small necklace showed up with broken rings. Was able to repair with needle nosed plies but it is overall poorly made,2
1954,"It's pretty but was over priced, I compared prices after I purchased and it was actually a set and was doldrums seperately.",2
1970,"It was very pretty, but it snapped in half an hour of wearing it. Good thing it was only a buck fifty.",2
1993,It broke in half the second day.  =/  It was cute though.,2
1996,Don't get this ring. It broke in half within 1 minute of being on my finger. Don't waist your money.,2
2006,"I liked it when I first got it, but after about half a week of having it, it broke in half. Pretty sad.",2
2010,easily broken not too good for ppl with small/thin fingers because when you adjust it to a smaller size it makes a crease in the middle and breaks.,2
2029,It was adorable but broke the first time I wore it.,2
2037,It is coated and the silver coating comes off quickly to show a copper colored base,2
2063,Pretty ring... Did turn finger green and silver comes off,2
2074,It is really beautiful but my finger is green :(,2
2075,Its very pretty but turned a day after i wore it,2
2078,"Fall down all the time, gave to my daughter and she loves them.",2
2097,I didn't feel like this was any better than a thick mascara.,2
2121,The quality is not what I expected in that the description makes a better product than it is.,2
2135,I did not use before I returned so I cannot review the product. I returned because I did not want a sponge made in China,2
2156,It's a bit dry and not smooth when it goes on. I sometimes add a bit of mineral oil to make it easier.,2
2183,"Very dry product, ended up mixing with moisturizer so I could apply it.  You get what you pay for.",2
2198,One was in pieces when I took it out of the package.,2
2207,I loved mine but it broke after like 2 weeks. Sad.,2
2235,Looks nothing like the picture and isn't adjustable to make choker necklace I'm disappointed. It was pretty,2
2240,Hard time staying on my nose and left marks on them!,2
2244,Not what i expected. lol kinda hurts when you wear it for a long time.,2
2257,One of pieces slips off the nose and won't anchor.  The other is too tight and hurts.  Hard plastic.  Very cheap.,2
2261,does emphasize even the smallest dry patches on the lips.,2
2277,The quality was great! The manquins face had dents in it. The hair was very uneven at the ends.,2
2315,I have been using this product religiously for over a month----twice a day.  I am seeing NOTHING!,2
2317,Does nothing for dark circles so I'm not sure what the advertising is all about.,2
2319,"Did not help my moms puffiness, lines or anything.",2
2327,"Okay for eye cream, but did not do much for puffiness, which is what I need.",2
2328,"The area around my yes become dry and wrinkles appear. Very dried my skin for about 1 week of use, will not buy again",2
2337,"did not work for me, plus it was to be a free sample, just pay for the postage but my credit card was charged almost $90.00",2
2340,"Purchased this product for the dark circles under my eyes, following directions the product didn't work for me.",2
2352,Not really seeing any results I guess I need to use it for more than 3-4 weeks,2
2359,"Started using but no results,  still  have puffiness around eyes.",2
2367,The cream smelled great but did nothing to help with fading the circles under my eyes. I was very disappointed.,2
2409,The eye cream does not absorb into skin. It looks like the cream is just sitting right on top of the eye area.,2
2410,I hate to say it but I have not seen a difference whatsoever and I've been using this product daily for a few weeks.,2
2412,"I've been using it for a few weeks now, no real changes. The under eye area is still puffy and dark.",2
2422,It acts as a good under the eye moisturizer. ONLY.,2
2425,"Feels nice and smells nice, but didn't do anything for the circles under my eyes!",2
2431,Didnt work for me at all..i have had dark circles for a long time but i  guess this product is not my solution,2
2436,"I have noticed smoother skin around the outside of my eyes, however, no improvement with puffy eyes or dark circles.",2
2437,I have only been using it for a few days .Still to early to know how good it is.,2
2448,"feels great going on, but disappointing results. I am returning it.",2
2449,I see no significant change after two months of use.,2
2476,"I only use it for about a week,  nothing happens yet...if anything changes,  I will write another review.",2
2502,Save your money. I would not recommend this to anybody.,2
2506,"Did not make a difference for me, I had tried it for 2-3 weeks no changes",2
2510,"Possibly stressed my immune system, got shingles 3 days after using for the first time.",2
2511,I haven't noticed much of a difference and I started using it over 2 weeks ago but I will finish the bottle and keepy fingers crossed,2
2526,Light is not very good. Polish works good when I purchased a stronger light. It would take two hours using this light.,2
2559,lace in the front isn't nearly as long as pictured.,2
2567,"Looks cheap, feels cheap. And the headband is not comfortable. I had to go to the masquerade party with no mask :(",2
2574,Stitching is not even.  The face fabric was lop-sided.,2
2580,"The veil is uneven and not long enough, and the ears need to be carefully managed so the veil doesn't slip when your head moves",2
2604,"The fragrance lasted for only a few moments, then it was gone. Wasn't worth it honestly.",2
2649,It says waterproof but it's NOT .I use them for make-up instead of shampooing.,2
2653,"Foil started coming off as soon as I tried to open it, returned",2
2667,It leaves a bad black soap scum on the sides of my tub,2
2677,"It does a great job, but you have to charge it up to 16 hours to get 1/2 hour worth of battery life.",2
2700,This gets 2 stars simply for difficulty of installation. What a wrestling match....,2
2709,Ripped apart when trying to pull it over the pistol tube.,2
2761,These facial creams have not worked well for me.  I don't know what needs to occur for them to work but I have never gotten satisfaction.,2
2777,"It smells absolutely amazing, but it also leaves a very waxy coating anywhere you apply it.",2
2778,I think regular coffee grounds would be as effective and same consistency,2
2780,"Seal was apparently broken and product leaked into the plastic it was wrapped in.  What's left is dried up, stinky mess.",2
2782,Product irritated and burned my eyes. I did although appreciate the kind follow up by the company,2
2785,"Didn't work...a waste of money....there were no instructions for this item, they were faded on the outside.",2
2786,"I've been using about 3 weeks, I have yet to see any noticeable difference",2
2787,used this 2x a day for a month & didn't see any improvement.,2
2808,This definitely helps me sleep but every time I take it I get very vivid nightmares. I'm wondering if this happens to others as well.,2
2818,"i wasn't expecting this to do anything and it sure didn't, but sometimes it's nice to buy stupid treats for yourself.",2
2847,"Being slow and gentle, it almost broke on my first REALLY loose starter lock.
If metal was stronger it'd be worth the price",2
2848,Sadly I received it today and the hook was broken  Soo i didn't get to use it.,2
2857,Disappointed. the advertisement shows 2 of these tools but there is only one. Seems bad advertisement to me.,2
2871,the product didn't stick very well and was see through.,2
2873,"If you're wearing these on your heels to protect from high heels that rub, they don't stay stuck",2
2888,You have to use a few strips to cover a tattoo not just one.,2
2893,If you like the look of pulled/bunched skin then this is for you!,2
2917,It was much easier to use years back.  Hard to apply evenly.,2
2977,Very cheaply made (ships from China). Runs VERY small.,2
2984,I was not expecting the excessive padding. Quality is good though.,2
3002,"It's very small, and narrow = child size.",2
3036,Used it for 3 weeks and didn't notice any difference,2
3039,I don't like how it smells and haven't seen any result for 2 months now.,2
3043,"Smooth, smelled nice...no difference what so ever in hyper pigmentation left over from acne",2
3052,"Not really a noticeable difference, just oily, have been using it for a couple weeks-does make you nice and soft though!!",2
3054,Used appx 15 times and do not see a significant difference :(,2
3060,Only had it for a week but I love that it absorbs quickly and no bad smell waiting on results,2
3061,I used it for my bikini area and nether regions but didn't see any different,2
3070,"Have been using it since it arrived, and have seen no difference whatsoever, will not purchase
it again.",2
3087,Lol almost paid 30 bucks for tgi and its freaking small smh i swear it better work or ima be pist off,2
3119,Not as exfoliating as I thought it'd be. I went with ecotools exfoliating loofah from Whole Foods and it's holding up and scrubs better,2
3122,Disappointed! They are thin and round like a doughnut.,2
3133,Not a fan. Barely holds a suds and the texture just isn't as good as a standard cheap plastic loofah.,2
3141,Kept sliding around and the flower on the ring fell off right away.,2
3146,So cute but horrible quality.  It broke the first day I wore it :(,2
3151,Broke on Tues first wearing.  Had to fix it.,2
3154,all of the fancy parts (rose on the ring and most of the bead work) fell off during transit or on the first try-on.,2
3159,"Cheap quality, won't be able to get more then one use out of it.",2
3179,Better to go to gym and workout lose weight faster.,2
3193,The razor is good but the scissors cut the hair sideways.,2
3194,I do not like them. There too big and bulky,2
3228,"Uncomfortable, does,t hold shape, flattens too fast",2
3234,This device is very uncomfortable therefore I was unable to sleep!,2
3253,Cut frizz but a lack luster product.  Definitely does not straighten at all.,2
3319,"Buttons came off. Fits perfect on my body, but the buttons at the neck aren't reliable.",2
3329,Kinda' soft silicone....not much of an exerciser.  Looks obscene too.,2
3330,Way overpriced for a product that doesn't fit in the mouth correctly.,2
3356,"I have had the product for five days, it is to soon to tell if it works. No reaction to the product.",2
3358,Hardly noticed any increased length or thickness after 6 months of regular nightly use. Disappointed. Will go try Rapidlash which was what my friend originally recommended.,2
3363,"Have not noticed a difference. I've had success with RapidLash, Fanomenal and of course Latisse, but this doesn't seem to work.",2
3387,"Did not work well.
Felt like suction cup trying to pull eye out of socket.",2
3394,I found it difficult to use. My fingers work better.,2
3395,They are smaller than what I was looking for - so do not work that well,2
3450,Very cheaply made.  Nothing like the picture but you get what you pay for.,2
3451,Ok for the price.  Not high quality.  Probably won't be able to wear it more than once or twice before it breaks.,2
3476,"Smaller than expected, and very bad smell that took two weeks to fade.",2
3482,Cute little makeup bag but only lasted a few months before it started to rip apart...,2
3511,"Not what I expected, bag is real flimsy and not nearly the size I thought it would be. Won't hold much.",2
3520,"I was sent a pack with mostly eyeliner, there were only 2 lipliners",2
3541,Very artificial taste and you will barely be able to open ur mouth,2
3564,Colors are great for the price. they break easily.,2
3568,"Colors are deceiving, they are all very similar with very orange undertones",2
3587,Most of the pencils were not the color that they said they were most of them were different shades of red,2
3595,You get what you pay for ! I wouldn't recommend these pencils to anyone. Only one or two are useable .,2
3629,"These are pigments; but, they rub off easily. Not what I thought they would be!",2
3631,Colors are great but they have an odd odor to them. I don't think I could wear them everyday because of the smell.,2
3634,"The pencils are ok, but they are not Italia deluxe, little disappointing.",2
3648,Did not include the one color I wanted. Cola. Last time I purchased the set it included Cola. Disappointed.,2
3655,"While the color goes on nice and easy, it doesn't stay on long at all.",2
3667,Not the correct colors are portrayed. Made me sad Bc they slide on nicely but the colors are off.,2
3731,In one use it needs to be sharpened.. it goes on smoothly but i would t repurchase,2
3734,This colors do not go well with darker skin tones.,2
3799,I like the liners and the colors but it' suppose to be a 12pc and I only received 8pc.,2
3805,Too many colors that look the same.  Product has to constantly be reapplied.,2
3815,"Its not 12 different colors, its just 6 colors not like what i see in the product info.",2
3843,I didn't get a nice variety More than half were some sort of dark brown,2
3875,"I ordered 3 of them, each looks different and have different set of colors!",2
3882,Horrible color choices. Only 2 colors I would use. I took a chance. Still the two colors I like are good quality.,2
3923,Color do the stay and not good quality really! at all,2
3942,"Does not last, does not keep lipstick from running. I rather spend $14 on a mac pencil.",2
3955,The colors I got were terrible in my opinion. They don't last long & they wipe off so easily!,2
3960,Way too soft. You may as well line your lips with your lipstick...,2
3971,Really drying good color pay off but i don't use them so harsh on my lips,2
3987,I would not repurchase! They break very easily. The color selection is good but not worth it.,2
4013,"The pinks, are more like neons. I thought they would be more mauve/neutral.
I literally have to re-apply every 30-45 minutes.",2
4061,I'm missing nearly all the colors described and have received different colors than is described! Very unhappy!,2
4064,These lip liners left a nasty taste in my mouth. I don't understand with a nasty taste came from but I had to send them back.,2
4065,6 out of 12 pencils are brown and I will never use that color.  Not as pictured.,2
4090,For light and fair skin. Goes on smooth because it's so thin. You get what you pay for. Shipping was fast.,2
4139,I like the light colors but the dark colors I toss the out,2
4165,Product sticky...applying lip gloss or lip oniment helps eliminate the sticky like residue,2
4187,Didn't have any effect that I could tell. Generally I'm obsessed with Alba products. Too bad.,2
4195,"Did not help diminish acne, smell was too overpowering for day time use and was drying for my skin.",2
4208,Ordered this set and received it with two pearl dots missing from it. Also the flower set looks nothing like photo,2
4212,"Pretty, but way bigger than I thought they would be.",2
4245,Did not work for me.  My coconut oil mixture I make myself works much better for a fraction of the cost.,2
4249,"Meh, didn't work for me. Oh, well.",2
4250,I'm not a very stinky woman and I have a deskjob. After a few hours it does me no good.,2
4258,Unfortunate this product gave me a rash under my arms. Smells great though (lavender/vanilla).,2
4271,It made me break out in a rash. It does have a warning on it that says may irritate some people's skin.,2
4273,"Only worked for me about half the day, disappointed bc it was expensive. It does have a nice texture.",2
4276,Bought this for my wife. She try to for a few days. And it still made her itch.,2
4292,The colors are a bit flat.  I didn't like them,2
4353,It's just not enough it's nice and beautiful but not practical the handle it's not working it drives me crazy :(,2
4361,DID NOT WORK ON MY WIFE. WASNT DARK AND CAME AS SOON AS WENT IN OCEAN. FEEL SAD FOR HER,2
4364,Couldn't get past the smell. I gave it away.,2
4366,Nothing special about it. I wouldn't buy it again.,2
4390,"Short result once i wash may hand, all the softness goes away",2
4405,I wish this product worked for me but it did not.  It was irritating to my eyes and made them burn.,2
4451,"needs to be reapplied often, especially in the warm humid days",2
4463,"Great coverage, but too drying and highlighted lines and wrinkles.",2
4464,Took almost a month to get this. Not worth it.,2
4510,Cute little ring. Doesn't stay shiny very long but didn't cost much,2
4519,Beautiful product that tarnished within TWO days of wearing.  :(,2
4535,I have cleaned these brushes 5 times and they still smell like a factory. The brushes themselves work fine if you can get past the smell.,2
4542,"Don't be fooled by the picture of the model wearing the earrings on this page. The earrings are much, much smaller than that.",2
4550,I gave 2 stars for the fun aspect of it but otherwise it doesn't actually do anything for your lips.,2
4554,"What did I just buy?  This was a nice little gimmicky purchase, but I saw no difference in my lips after 4 consecutive nights using it.",2
4556,Pretty Slimy but I think it may help plump...a very little though,2
4560,Not that great. I itch a lot after using it.,2
4571,A big pricey bar of soap. Lather is good. Scent is pretty much gone upon application.,2
4595,"It seems okay on the skin, but the fragrance is just way too much for me.",2
4653,Nothing special.  I'll Dial N for nope and get something Different next time,2
4687,"Did not care for the smell, what there is of it. Won't be reordering.",2
4696,I did not care for this at all. Stings your skin. Awful smell.,2
4705,"smell good,but dn't hold to long on body",2
4708,Good lather and lasts long. Smells like a solvent. Don't love it.,2
4737,"Smells amazing! Looks pretty! Left my skin dry, almost squeaky clean!",2
4775,It did not meet my expectations it was not as nice on the skin as a previous soap I had. by another company.,2
4780,"I got the Rosemary Mint soap, and the scent is not prominent or lingering.",2
4782,Don't get Honey Almond unless you like rubbing small sharp rocks on your skin.  The other scents I've tried are fine.,2
4792,"Doesn't have much scent, and doesn't lather up. Won't buy this brand again",2
4794,The soap is not sensitive on the skin and might cause irritation for the dry types of skin,2
4802,Disappointed almost no smell chose  Rose fragrance previous critiques all good very lathers good creamy packaging looked old and dry think that's why no smell.,2
4820,not much of a fragrance to the soap.  You can't smell anything.  Even after you wash your hands there still is no smell.,2
4890,The soap is full of particles so its more like a bar exfoliant than a milk soap,2
4920,"It has a very candy-like scent, not at all what expected.",2
4930,It's not the white bar pictured. It looks like reconstituted broccoli. 2 stars cuz that's impressive.,2
4935,I use milled soap daily. 1st time to buy this one.  Nice soap but the lemon scent is like a lemon dish washing liquid.,2
5009,Disappointed by  lack of scent.  Nice lather though.  I would not buy again.,2
5111,It smelled good but felt like sandpaper. It's really gritty and rough.,2
5112,the soap is smell very good but the price are a too high.,2
5118,The large bar didn't lather up as well compared to the Lemongrass bar. The scent was fair but I will not order this Shea bar again.,2
5322,"Not the minty fresh kind I was hoping for, wish they made a better one or liquid type. Also left a film on skin.",2
5352,The clasp jammed right away so I never was able to wear it.,2
5361,"I am missing one pack of the eyelids patch. In totally, I only got 18 out of 20.",2
5385,DID not help and left a dry flim on your skin,2
5395,I purchased as a all natural aid for seep. It did not seem to help. The product is very oily.,2
5397,"I never got my comprehensive ebook that is promised with this item. Also, there was not a hole in the spray bottle to spray it out.",2
5407,"So far, I have not have relief from my let cramps. Also, it really burns.",2
5426,"Its a beautiful color, got tangled very fast as most synthetics do,  but it was for Halloween so it did the trick.",2
5444,At first I thought it was beautiful and all sorts of stuff which it is at first but it goes to s*** after don't waste money on this,2
5445,Poor quality. Tried it on once & when I ran my fingers through it the hair started falling out. Returning...,2
5464,"I have not noticed much progress, but guess I'll keep using it since I have 2 bottles.",2
5493,Very low quality. Came with the zippers broken. Would have loved to have something to hang it by.,2
5496,"Doesn't form the CUBOID shape shown in the image. It just falls flat, but otherwise the quality is good.",2
5527,"Read the label:  ""Made whith (sic) organic....""  You lost me at ""with"" misspelled.  NOT certified organic.",2
5547,"The original picture of this color showed it looking more sparkley.  After receiving it, it's basically white with the faintest pearly shimmer.",2
5599,"These are completely flat and offer almost no arch support, which is the whole purpose of the product.",2
5605,"Burns my eyes. I have used other products, so my eyelashes were long.  Quit this before I could know whether it works.",2
5607,This brush is very thin. It's much lower quality than other brushes I've purchased for the same price. I'll be throwing it out.,2
5620,"It is very pretty, but arrived with a crystal missing and it was stretched out.",2
5653,Just like plastic but u get what u pay for  For for an upcoming event,2
5661,"Stones very pretty, chain is very cheap looking. Doesn't do the heart justace",2
5675,Clasp broke before I was able to wear it....no good,2
5688,The clasp was broke had to be replaced otherwise I like it,2
5690,"I received but ,One of the rhinestones that fell out. So I can't give it know good review.",2
5691,soon as I opened the pack the links fell off...it's pretty but not a good quality,2
5758,Didn't repair my hair...hair felt just as dry and damaged if not more after using it.,2
5767,"Too sweet of a scent, not sure what it did for my hair.",2
5791,"It doesn't get very hot and didn't really curl my eyelashes.  My regular curler worked faster, better and is less expensive",2
5792,I don't think it curls very well...but it was worth a shot,2
5805,"Hard to take off even with warm water or make up remover .
Not the best",2
5810,"Arrived early, It does the job,and it works very well  but the tube came almost completely empty,",2
5812,"Works, but barely any glue in there! All air and little bit of glue that's very messy. But cheap and works.",2
5814,This eyelash was SO messy and got everywhere! It was really sticky and I can tell it would last long but it was just too messy for me,2
5829,I used to use this until I discovered the Tung brand.  Now I've switched as the Tung seems to work better for me.,2
5859,Product took WAY TOO LONG to arrive! Almost 4 months! Product as pictured.,2
5873,Doesn't work like it's supposed to be. Wouldn't buy it again,2
5884,Did nothing for me when I had my belly button pierced.,2
5927,Didn't do well healing my piercing  . I definitely wouldn't recommend this product.,2
5948,"Doesn't fit the best, just depends on the ear, and you have to put it on a certain place on your ear.",2
5953,Very flimsy and won't fit on my ear like the picture.,2
5954,It doesn't fit. At all. And I don't have large ears. Booo.,2
5976,works as it should but spray mechanism failed with the bottle more than half full.,2
5982,"I hate this stuff it makes my hair so ratty and tangled, also it gives it this powdery feel!",2
6006,I don't like it because it has nothing to it.,2
6010,"Good for a few weeks, nice for one-time events to match with friends.",2
6029,It's cute. Great gift for young girl. You get what you pay for.,2
6041,Does not fit like the picture.  Not a choker!!! Beware of this china piece.,2
6074,"Would not spend money again for this product, there are cheaper ones on market that do the same thing. Item just ok.",2
6084,Not what I was expecting...not helping at all!,2
6144,It feels very leathery when applied and is very difficult to get off. Not good.,2
6148,the color is very nice but the product makes your lips feel odd and cakey,2
6151,Not shiny like the photo at all. It stays on well but was looking for something that wasn't matte.,2
6157,"The color was a lot more shimmery and lighter than I expected. Wasn't the best color look on me, but excellent product",2
6183,"Nice results on wet hair, but the blades keep falling out! Just buy the name brand!",2
6217,It was cheap looking and bigger than I thought it would be. Of course I only paid a dollar for it so what did I expect lol.,2
6222,I really really wanted to live these products but I received broken bottles. very heartbreaking,2
6239,Water went inside the battery area. Not waterproof at all.,2
6242,I liked the product but after two weeks water got to the inside and shorted it out. It was never in direct water spray or submerged,2
6247,I used this product faithfully and did not see any growth AT ALL to my lashes.  Oh well!,2
6249,I didn't see any improvement--so I went back to Latisse,2
6250,It  did not do much to thicken or lengthen my lashes!,2
6253,It did not work for me. I really wanted it to work but it didn't.  I hope it works for everyone else,2
6257,No progress noted even after 2 months of 2 x daily use.  Still continuing-,2
6315,"I was excited for this product to be helpful.  Used it daily,  didn't see any results or difference in my skin.",2
6318,Disappointed made my face feel ok but did not help with the wrinkles which was the main reason to purchasing aBOOTS NO 7. ALSO TO EXPENSIVE,2
6319,Did not work for me as advertised. I did not see any improvement in wrinkles. My skin was not as smooth after using it.,2
6385,I USED IT FOR TWO MONTHS .........I STILL HAVE MY ORIGINAL WRINKLES....,2
6402,The container is very very small for the $$$ you pay. Like the fact it's all natural with essential oils mixed with baking soda.,2
6412,Looks cute in the picture but really odd in real life.,2
6443,"Out of all the colors, most of them were basically orange or pink.  I was very disappointed in these.  I would not buy them again.",2
6467,I didn't really care it. I fell like it's to strong.,2
6485,Got moldy after about 2 weeks. It was comfortable while it lasted... Cannot properly dry out all the holes after each use.,2
6502,"It came on time,  BUT IT CAME DIRTY
After it spent some time in the washer it does what it is suppose to do.",2
6557,NOT RED. This is a really bright pink. I was very disappointed.,2
6569,Not what I expected from the source material...a waste of money.....gb,2
6570,"Much to rough for this 70 year old back.  However, I might find some use for it removing bark from trees.",2
6579,need a bigger loofah area to small for a mans use.,2
6593,Wasn't really what I was looking for. I'm going to look into something a bit more user friendly.,2
6614,The loofah and cloth are too different in flexibility as materials and you're not able to get a good scrub after a couple of uses.,2
6617,given as a gift...it's a very stiff loofa for anything but feet. doesn't dry fast enough just hanging in the shower.,2
6669,"Too liquidy, and the pump makes a mess because of that. Haven't seen the result of using it yet.",2
6676,"Message to Manufacturer / seller,

Change your Amazon Advertisement immediately. Your product doesn't contain retinol. I will be reporting this.",2
6723,This didn't seem to do much as far as repelling mosquitos.....,2
6770,Or doesn't work on south fl type of mosquitoes :/,2
6772,Nice packaging but these things don't work! I got bit in Hawaii regardless of how many of these i wore.,2
6773,You probably need to wear a couple of them at the time to see a result,2
6774,I put 4 of these on and the mosquitoes could care less!,2
6792,"On day 3, there was a mosquito on my knee while I had the bracelet on my ankle only inches away...",2
6794,"I wore one on wrist, one on ankle, but I got bites on arms and legs. Not effective in my experience.",2
6799,It doesn't repel mosquitoes at all.  They land right next to it.,2
6804,Don't know if this is really working.. got mosquito bite on the arm where I was wearing this bracelet...,2
6806,Do not work was using in Jamiacia and mosquito repellent was useless,2
6812,"Unfortunately, I was bitten on my ankles, elbows and wrists.  I must need something stronger.",2
6816,These didn't work really well for my family. I loved the discounted price.,2
6881,The smell is almost unbearable but it does the trick. Used this for sfx wounds with fake blood and other cosmetics and it looked pretty gruesome.,2
6899,"Felt more like elmers glue rather than liquid latex. Serves it purpose, but doesn't feel so great coming off.",2
6975,It's hard to use and gets everywhere.  better off using the Ben Nye Nose and Scar Wax for gashes or cuts.,2
6985,"Not thick enough, takes too long to dry. Stick with Ben Nye brand",2
7005,They are to short for the large bottle.  About 1 inch short.,2
7032,The earrings turn green and look very old. Will not buy again.,2
7037,"Definitely designed for younger girls. Would not pass for ""intermediate priced"" jewerly. Guess this is a case of you get what you paid for",2
7038,Looked great out of the packet but discolored within two days of wearing them,2
7047,not quality as stated.....was gift but not the quality it looks like honestly,2
7061,"Very tiny, and I do not have bigger ear lobes either !",2
7068,Cheap quality. Doesn't hold vacuum if you move muscle or place the vacuum cup sideways.,2
7075,You get what you pay for and they were cheap so what more can I say,2
7108,The overall look and color is different from what the picture suggests. Be careful...,2
7121,The smell of this product is horrendous. I can't use the product because of the stench.,2
7190,I just received these and I tried the pink and my lips feel tacky and weird may have to return.,2
7191,Not good - comes off really easily/quickly. Don't waste your money!,2
7206,"I couldn't handle the ""old lady perfume"" smell of this.  I had to return it.",2
7249,Charger fall apart after month and before the charger fell apart the device stopped charging. just purchase the AMORE.,2
7255,It has stopped working in one year and it was barely used...  even though its fully charged it it stops working within a few seconds...,2
7299,I'm not a fan . It doesn't really seem to remove any calluses. I used it a few times and didn't see any results,2
7301,"It seemed to work well in the beginning but after about ten cycles, the charger burned.",2
7396,It broke within a few months of having it.  Case is poor quality,2
7404,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and the first time she went to use the clippers they fell apart.,2
7412,The nail clipper broke during  first use. Good looking instruments. but made of cheap material.,2
7427,Meh. It's not as good as the other reviews make it. I wonder if the other reviews were talking about the same product .,2
7437,They were cute but they were whopedsided. Not cool!,2
7479,"Received but not colored, just white. Not what I had expected.",2
7494,Beautiful but way too small. It is extremely tight and uncomfortable on the average head size.,2
7495,Stones were a lose and had to glue them before wearing them.,2
7496,Super cute real shiny love it! But when I put it on a section of the bling piped off.,2
7525,"I am a big fan of tea tree oil and use it almost daily, however this particular brand smells strongly of pine sol.",2
7554,They looked bigger than they actually were. A bit Misleading,2
7555,The dappen dishes that I received do work fine; however they look nothing like the picture that is advertised.  I am disappointed.,2
7562,"Looks larger on the picture. The only reason I didn't return, did not pay much for it. Should show actual size.",2
7573,"It doesn't hold my hair in place after I close it, so as i'm cutting my hair it moves and I cut it crooked.",2
7602,Not as good as other skin tighteners I have used.,2
7604,Too oily. it would probably be  great if it weren't so oily and just smeared everywhere,2
7611,It was a good idea but the stick doesn't work as good as hoped.,2
7616,It's kinda chunky and it barely has any shimmer at all.,2
7626,Best for light or white skin. Difficult to blend on women of color,2
7651,It's okay doesn't blend well I actually use it as lip stick instead,2
7661,They are ok. A little to firm so it makes using the different shapes a little difficult.,2
7664,Good price but not very good quaility. In this sense you kind of get what you pay for. Sponges are very stiff.,2
7670,Ok quality.  They did not hold up as well as others.  They got frizzy.,2
7671,These were not feathers at all. I should have checked the description better.  Very cheap quality indeed.,2
7675,Very fake looking and feeling. I would not recommend.,2
7681,I was expecting to receive feathers for my hair. Hair feathers. What I got in the mail was actual synthetic hair extensions dyed with a feather-like pattern,2
7683,They will not stay in my daughter's hair. Disappointed,2
7686,Great if you go to YouTube for instructions but loses suction after 4 times.,2
7687,its cheap.  doesnt work like a real microdermabrasion machine.,2
7689,It does not suck it up as I expected.  Very difficult to assemble.,2
7690,I use only the blackhead suction.  The diamond heads didn't work well.,2
7715,Worked well until the bristle backing came off the handle.,2
7724,The part where you close the Cape pinches the customer and if uncomfortable to use it is just attached to a pin vs using velcro,2
7731,"Only for natural nail, its not good for extension nails :(",2
7743,"Ok, but very small and the packaging was not gift worthy. A little crushed when I received it.",2
7786,Very pretty but didn't last long until the bottom broke off,2
7797,Terrible product for a premium price. Didnt work for me at all. Had to purchase another anesthetic. And the seller refused to accept it back,2
7898,"They were okay, but very small and didn't do too much to the bath.",2
7899,"Small and didn't do much in the line of smell, color or bubbles when compared to a LUSH bomb",2
7904,They were all broken.  Lots of grit got all over my floors when unpacking.  They smell good but don't leave water feeling silky.,2
7905,Much smaller than expected . They are the size of golf balls and do not smell great.,2
7917,"I've enjoyed using this every day since it arrived. However, after only four months the arm broke off and it is unrepairable.",2
7984,"These don't hold your hair right.  Buy large old fashioned clips, they work better.",2
7990,It's probably just me but I have no idea how to put these on. The paper instructions are no help.,2
7992,"Wish it would've come with instructions, but YouTube works just fine",2
7994,"I watched video on YouTube, read the notice and I still cannot figure how to use these... disappointed!!",2
7997,I didn't like the product. I rather french braid my own hair,2
7999,"Unable to use on myself
Maybe it's a matter of Learning",2
8006,This lotion is a bit too watery for me. Don't like the smell either.,2
8015,They were larger than I expected.  Garlic gets lost in it and doesn't work as well as I expected.,2
8043,The ends are sharp and cut  and pull my hair. ends need to be covered with something,2
8068,"The stain did not work for me, but it worked for my mother. I'm confused on the product.",2
8070,"Takes to long to work, then just looks like I ate something red.",2
8077,"Seems like it would work really well, but it froze in shipping so it may have ruined the consistency",2
8081,This stuff doesn't work like I had seen it in makeup reviews.,2
8093,The color is lighter than expected and does not stay longer.,2
8141,"Probably a decent product, but it made me break out in a rash.",2
8167,It made my skin feel bad. Like it was stripping all of the moisture but not actually cleaning.,2
8170,i have combination skin and i've noted this product drys my face out completely,2
8184,Too tightening and harsh on my pores. Doesn't smell like green tea at all. Wouldn't buy again.,2
8212,This product made me and my friend break out! I wouldn't recommend if you have sensitive skin.,2
8372,"I use on acrylics and it lifts, peels and chips. Not very durable",2
8381,"The smell is way too strong. Moisturizing, but I notice no difference regarding stretch marks.",2
8396,I couldn't get past the smell of this unfortunately.,2
8408,No noticible growth. Intense stinging. Not my favorite.,2
8411,"This solution burned my eyes. I am used to using Latisse, so just keep your eyes closed until it dries!",2
8416,Stings if it gets in your eye! Takes a long time to notice the growth and fullness.,2
8423,After 4 weeks of applying I still have not had any results. I'd spend your money on a higher end product and gain results faster.,2
8430,No difference after 4 months and it stings my eyes if any drips into them.,2
8442,Haven't seen any change in length or volume in 3 weeks.,2
8444,"I have used it everyday but I did not see any improvement with my eyelashes.
It causes some irritations with my eyes..
It was not worth it.",2
8445,"Unfortunately, this product didn't work for me. I honestly had hoped it would but I never noticed a difference.",2
8446,Used as instructed for 3 months. Absolutely nothing happened. Easy to apply. Burns a little when freshly applied but not bad.,2
8448,It is so thin that it is difficult not to get it in your eye.  Used it for a month and no noticeable difference in the length.,2
8463,I had to stop using it since every time it would sting my eye  :-(,2
8476,"I Have used this product daily for two weeks now.
I have noticed very little change in my eyelash growth.",2
8496,I have not had any change in my lashes and if you are not careful putting it on and it gets in your eyes it burns really bad.,2
8505,I have not seen any changes at. Will update if that changes.,2
8509,I did not see any difference in the two weeks I used it except that it made my eyes itch.,2
8519,I have been using it with results yet. This is all i can give for s review right now.,2
8520,This product does not work at all...used it for over 2 months with absolutely no results,2
8536,"I did not notice a difference. I have used a different product in the past, which worked much better.",2
8543,Been using this product for over a month and do not see a difference.,2
8544,I wanted this to really work but I saw no improvement at all,2
8552,I have not seen any difference since i started using the product.,2
8562,I have been using for a couple of weeks now and do not see much difference.  Will keep trying.,2
8586,"Product is fine, I just don't know how to use it and make it look real",2
8607,So incredibly thin...absolute waste of your money.  Buy something else.,2
8663,not the heavy loofahs I ordered the first time that I ordered.,2
8700,Fragrance was weak. Large generous bar in a beautiful wrapping.,2
8720,Didn't work for me. Ended up with spots. Will remain pale.,2
8722,"I have bought other pile but this one smells moldy, will not buy again.",2
8744,"I love the belly ring itself. It is pretty and looked great! However, the dangle fell off after only a week of wearing it.",2
8751,"It was fine on my hair, but it made my eyes burn.",2
8763,It seems 2 clog every other color change...regret I spent money on pro set,2
8766,Doesn't clean very well.  Left residue. Do not recommend.,2
8768,If you are just starting dreads make sure you have 6-12 inches of growth. If you do not don't waste your money.,2
8773,"I had gotten one once before at a skincare store. Loved it. This one, did not work nearly as well.",2
8779,Didn't see any results plus it's a bit messy .you have to be very patient. No I don't like the product not for me,2
8784,"This was not what I thought it was.  I wanted a guide that was 1 1/2"" high.  This was considerably short in height.",2
8832,"Shipping took forever and a day, lots of duplicate colors, and on top of it all they are too big for my nose.",2
8837,Daughter not using and it's not that cute once it is on. Waste of money!,2
8838,"Looks completely fake.  Good if you're going for that vibe, I guess.",2
8839,It'd be nice if it came in more neutral colors.,2
8853,The colors when on do not match the colors in the images to the point where I thought I received the wrong product. Wouldn't order again.,2
8855,true colors on these that I bought but it peels off after 3 days.,2
8871,"Two of the polishes, the glitter and white, were hardened blocks, completely unusable. You get what you pay for.",2
8874,Its not the best quality it but you get what u pay for..,2
8884,These colors are not true to what you get butthe polish isn't bad.,2
8889,The no wipe to coat didn't come with this product. Everything else did. The polish gaps. But two or three coats should work,2
8897,"colors are too transparent, does't look like the photo.",2
8907,The colors are too light. I had to put too many layers on to get a full coverage.,2
8908,I love the colours but the bottles are to to to to to small I give the bottles 0,2
8911,doesn't even stay for a week..no idea why...its cheap.i know..but comes out too fast too easy..whats wrong?,2
8952,leaves the eyebrows red tone. The gel is two-step application and difficult to apply,2
8966,Very disappointing.  Just a couple of small sheets of zig zag tape.,2
8985,not really happy with this file...too rough...does not leave smooth nails...won't reorder.,2
8991,The glass is too thick to file my nails very well.,2
9001,used glass files before and they worked great.  These take too long to file,2
9016,I ordered 2 of these. Both droken after a couple weeks. Very cute while they lasted though.,2
9045,"Not what I expected,  but when I compare picture to product it's right on. Look carefully before ordering!!!!",2
9047,"Is not like this picture, is different an low quality.",2
9064,You get what you pay for.  This doesn't look as cute as it does in the picture.  It looks more like 99 cent store jewelry.,2
9071,The chain on the top part was too long just over overlapped onto the bottom section and looked bad,2
9073,"This necklace is beautiful, but gave me a rash :( Really bummed because it's a great length and really pretty.",2
9101,Give me a skin irritation and it's too small for them in,2
9105,this patch may be good for lady's during their period. it heats your stomach but doesn't decrease your stomach fat,2
9110,It works but you have to keep on using to keep results,2
9140,"i used now the 5th wrap , with no results ... I have no idea when I will feel body shape",2
9142,It's all a bunch of hooey.  Does NOTHING don't waste your money.,2
9160,These bottles leak where the black top meets the bottom.,2
9181,Just completed using one full jar and I have not noticed one bit of difference in the skin tone on my neck.,2
9182,"not very impressed, like another product better, you get what you paid for.",2
9189,"My face was yellow orange after removing, didn't see any benefits,  very messy, had to use coffee grounds scrUbuntu to remove discoloration",2
9190,I thought this has a creamy texture. But it is so hard. Cant apply properly to the face. I do like the fragrance though.,2
9226,"""After the second application I could tell the difference, I would recommend this product. Thank you for following up!""",2
9227,"I am trying this serum for almost a month, but I don't see any different in my dark spot, so I won't buy it again",2
9231,I had a brown spot on my forehead. I used this product 3XADay.  It merely lighten the spot.  Still the same size-just lighter,2
9241,Used for three weeks as instructed with no visible fading of spots (not even the lighter spots).,2
9242,Very happy whit the delivery .....this product do not work for me ,2

9299,"It doesn't work too much , I fell the same thing before i uses them",2
9300,It didn't work for me. I was really hoping it would.,2
9342,I found this to be too big and bulky to use to apply self tanner. I have not used the exfoliating side yet.,2
9373,It's just a powder.  I thought it was a cream.  Doesn't do much. Especially for the price.,2
9376,Came cracked and the darker shades were in little loose powders all over,2
9395,"The designs weren't deep enough to hold nail polish, it's a shame because they're great designs.",2
9396,"item does not work. blurred polish ,no design.",2
9401,"its scratch on several of the designs, but the owl seems to be ok.",2
9404,"The edge is very sharp, it gave me a cut. Only two of the designs picked up properly.",2
9411,"DON'T REALLY LIKE IT, DON'T HATE IT, BUT NOT A HUGE FAN OVER THE PRODUCT.",2
9414,"sticky on the lips, colour is patchy and does not come off easily",2
9420,Very nice looking but when you put it on it sticking you lips together not a nice feeling.,2
9425,These have an odd bluish tint. I threw them away.,2
9442,"Love the smell but didn't moisturizers me my legs were dry looking, very disappointed in this expensive lotion.",2
9454,This product I heard was suppose to help tighten skin and it does not. But it is thick like a body butter and smells great.,2
9456,Smells good but feeling of dryness about an hour after applying,2
9524,Other than a simple cream! It really didn't do anything else :-) do not waste your money,2
9556,I already love the way my skin feels after using this product however when I opened the jar there was a portion taken out of it.,2
9562,Didn't stay on... I didn't like them.,2
9564,Don't work as well as Frownies or Smoothies. Too flexible.,2

9619,"This is so tiny, it is NOT worth the money!!!! My fault for not reading the details.",2
9626,Couldn't use it because it doesn't work for the Galaxy 5.,2
9628,YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONTINUESLY PLUGGED UP IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK,2
9634,"Sometimes it will stop charging, start again and stop again.",2
9636,does not shave anything have to keep going over the same space over and over,2
9685,I noticed no difference in my skin after using for 3 days.  I will not be purchasing this product again.,2
9688,The color is lighter than what you see it doesn't really have that style a little with the bangs,2
9753,The quality is poor. Skimpy towels and kind of soapy.,2
9773,"They are thin plastic and chip very easily, will not be buying again. They look cute though.",2
9776,"Pretty nails, but thin and they pop off or rip.",2
9779,Color not like in the picture. It looks more like dark burgundy,2
9800,"I got the darkest color (Raven), and it wasn't matte at all. Just really greasy/messy.  :/",2
9865,There's a damn jewel missing! I planned to wear it for my wedding. But can't do that when there is a jewel noticeably missing!,2
9884,"Sorry, had to give them away! They were to heavy for my earlobe. Was disappointed!",2
9920,does not work!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
9956,"Sorry I returned them, needed a finer tweezer for my eyebrows.",2
9979,I haven't seen any significant changes while using the Swiss ultimate ultrasonic. It is very easy to use and it's comfortable in your hand.,2
33,it's a  great over gloss for your lipstick. adds a glow. good buy on the 6 pack.,3
34,great product just shipping was longer then expected.... shouldn't have taken as long as it did.,3
56,I'm not sure they do everything promised.  They are alright but definitely don't meet all their claims.,3
116,"Does nothing to plump at all have used it for a week and nothing, carry as a chap stick in case my lips get dry",3
117,"Holy sting Batman! It works for a few minutes while your lips are on fire, then fades away.",3
123,I like this product it is really smooth but it does not necessarily makes my lips bigger.,3
132,"Does the job, just don't take the guards off or the blade will cut you like crazy!",3
135,This tool has definately given back the time I was losing just tweezing. Please make sure to pull skin tight because it can pull skin if not.,3
138,Not what expected but I still won't use any other companys soap this one had fennel and I didn't realize that and I'm not a fan,3
148,Very very strong smelling. I couldn't use it.,3
150,its feels nice but the smell is so pungent and overwhelming that I threw it away,3
155,A little too small for the price.  I will forever no the one I got earlier which was good.,3
180,"Difficult to put on ear, doesn't stay on the best but it's very cute!",3
188,I had troubles getting it to stick then it eventually broke.,3

So sad",3
234,Can barely discern the flowers but still has a nice look,3
240,"The flower section is not flat but more ""pokey"". I would say the product is not the same as the picture.",3
266,Worth it. I lost one the second day I wore them. For the price I got my money's worth.,3
274,"Alot smaller than I thought they would be, They are very cute though, I will giver them to  my 3 year old niece",3
277,"are small that I expected, but will make a nice stocking stuffer for Xmas!",3

319,"Hate the new curved bar, but I've used zest for 24 years.",3
327,I must had not read the description well. The size was not what I thought it was so I was disappointed in that. Quality is good,3
341,"Flimsy construction, but works well so far.  Keeping my fingers and toes crossed for its longevity.",3
348,Unfortunately my breasts are too large. I'm a 34 G. Doesn't seem to make a difference. Cute but not effective.,3
351,"Its too wide and i have to keep adjusting it. But, it is very soft and plush.",3
354,Its good but I'm 36D and it was too small for me .,3
365,"Diffuser works great, the car diffuser is so so.",3
372,Did not like the smell. Packaged great. You have to come directly home after tanning due to it leaves a nasty after smell,3
379,Works good but I think I need something a little stronger for my congested skin,3
383,"still trying item out , brought it cause they said it clears blemishes.",3
386,Arrived fast but i don't think this product is for me/ my skin type,3
387,Not sure yet. Maybe too soon to see results. Great flavor though.,3
423,"The chain is cute, but it's not what I ordered. I ordered Gold and I received Silver.",3
436,Works with lighter weight clothing but not as well on heavier fabrics or ones with texture.,3
438,I found that the adhesive did not hold as advertised. It is just okay.,3
507,Bought this for my 10-year old daughter. Wish it had an elastic attachment instead of the button to make it easier for her to twist and secure.,3
517,It's okay but I think the Aquis turban fits better because it has elasticized sides.,3
520,Doesn't really soak up the water like I would have thought it would.,3
524,"Broke in the first day, had to sew the loop that goes over the button. Works ok other than that.",3
541,"This is one of my favorite beauty items. I'm giving it 3 stars because I didn't know it was ""trial"" size.",3
552,"Super cute,  they don't stay in hair very well.  Good quality.",3
555,The clips are difficult to use and align with they should have just been put on the headband,3
568,They are good but they feel cheaply built. Still for the price not bad,3
569,Hard to keep in my hair. I'll experiment on ways to keep them in. But they're really cute,3
577,I love the feel and the color but the clips on the ears are not that stable. Other than that it looks awesome thanks!,3
597,"Guess it is good, but the liquid keeps oozing out from the top",3
598,I liked the soap... the only thing I didn't like was it seemed to leak around the top.,3
626,Nice colored lipstick...unfortunately the color disappears within the hour...how come?,3
630,It comes off very easily and the colors is very very light. I would use it on top of a lipstick but its not sufficient by itself.,3
632,Caused lip irritation. I must be allergic to something in it. Be cautious.,3
649,"So i like the product, but know that this is only ONE roller, the picture makes it seem like it is two.",3
651,arrived quickly but the large rollers do not roll. The small end does. Just ok for the money,3
654,"no instructions whatsoever, had to find the magazine article of which i had first seen it....",3
677,This stuff is great BUT ...it turns out you can buy it at Trader Joe's for half the price!,3
688,its okay i guess.. i mean it looks better in the picture and is smaller but cant complain you get what you pay for..,3
707,"It was ok not what expected, it's a little too heavy for my hair type.",3
714,Did not work very good on my granddaughter's type 3b or 3c,3
721,Didn't work for my natural 4b hair.  I tried a wash and go . It  was a fail ,3
737,I like the way it feels in my hands as I'm applying it to my hair. And the way it softens my hair when applying.,3
739,Too flaky when used. And no it doesn't not made my natural hair bouncy nor curly,3
740,The product works well in my hair! Good it's not greasy! It doesn't have that jeri curl smell to it like lustrasilk does.,3
751,It was okay as long as you used it by itself and your hair is extremely wet when you apply it.,3
752,Decent! I use it on my hair and my Daughter's and it gives good curls.,3
756,I like it but still need to use other products as well. Curly hair and humidity don't go together,3
768,"This is a pretty good product, but it smells too strongly.",3
783,I love the smell of this cream but I don't like how it feels :(,3
790,just okay...Dried out my hair in a few hours,3
793,Dries my hair and I don't like the way it makes my 4c gray hair feels.  I,3
799,Curls did not stay as tight as I hoped.. Stiff in beginning but softened,3
834,Not at all what I expected but still a great product,3
842,came broken. I tried to glue it back using superglue but it did not hold,3
860,I prefer a matte silver over this shiny silver. But better than black!,3
894,Don't know if it is working.  Still have neck pain after 5 treatments,3
946,Have not used product long enough to know yet if it is effective.,3
956,Didn't work for my itchy skin...we are now wondering if I am on a medication that makes my skin itch.,3
964,The product does not seem to work yet but I have not had it for more than a week.. It does not burn my feet.,3
966,"It smells a lot, and occasionally burns. I don't know it its normal or not.",3
981,"I didn't really see much benefit from it. Used on feet, temples, neck, no profound results.",3
989,"It's a very good magnesium oil spray, BUT it is incredibly itchy! We switched to another brand and have no issues now.",3
991,"I hate to say, but this is NOT less itchy than the other brands of magnesium oil I have purchased.",3
1000,Difficult to use the pump spray. Very itchy and messy. Not sure if it works but will try to finish using and may add comment then.,3
1016,I was a little dissapointed.  The consistency was really thin and did not absorb into the skin very well.,3
1020,NOT convinced that it works as advertised.  I have not witnessed any results for myself in using this product.,3
1041,"I took 4 bottles , I nearly finished 1 , maybe there is slight effect, I'll still continue using it",3
1045,Great shipping. Just not sure if I noticed a difference yet. Will keep trying.,3
1058,"It works well.  However, mine was delivered without the top.",3
1074,"i like how this product worked, but for someone with sensitive skin, i had some irritation.",3
1079,I really liked this product but was unhappy when the handle broke. It sure didn't last long. ,3
1119,"Too big for my infant, I'm sure it'll fit her when she becomes a toddler. Other than that it's exactly like the picture.",3
1123,"It looks cheaply made and won't  fit a baby's head, it's more for 3-5 year olds. But it is really cute!",3
1143,I love the smell it has. The only problem is they are too dry.,3
1174,It is much lighter weight than anticipated. I'll see how well it holds up over time.,3
1184,Only used the brush so far and seems to work great.  My only issue is the batteries don't last long.,3
1205,It's just ok. I have light skin and bought the darker shade for my legs. They look a tiny bit darker.,3
1222,Not sure if it does anything. Seems ok. Expensive though.,3
1229,"Just started using, I think this will take at least 2 weeks to see result.",3
1235,No improvement after 2 weeks but no adverse affect either. I am still looking for a product that actually does what they advertise.,3
1239,It's ok I haven't seen much difference! I have used enough buy haven't seen much difference !,3
1248,Very pretty but not comfortable at all. The diamond back poke me I wish it was cloth,3
1249,It looked really good but the rhinestone in the middle really dig into my forehead which made it a little uncomfortable.,3
1250,"It's an ok mask, but not as pretty as it looks in the picture. I didn't like it much, I had to return it",3
1251,"After taking it out from the bag it came in, some of the beads fell off. I had to glue them back.
Cute mask.",3
1280,Totally expected the size to be larger.  It's really really small.  I should have checked.  Price not worth the size,3
1281,Very cute! Smaller than I thought it would be.,3
1306,Very pretty looks just like picture. Definitely buying more.,3
1322,the brush is not on one of the wands and the other the bristles are falling off very easily.,3
1352,not sure if im using them right but they were as advertised,3
1354,First time using it and left it over night until the next day I think it worked! My belly was bigger than this.,3
1413,"There was a brush piece missing and it was pretty small, but it is cute.",3
1419,"So far no change, been using several weeks. But I am relieved that there has been no irritation.",3
1421,Worked great for a few months but now product won't stop bubbling out the sides when trying to spray,3
1447,"It works good but since it's a big size, it dries up quick even though lids are closed.",3
1450,Good hold.  Hair feeks sticky. Needed to add quite a bit of water to get it to a  usable consistency,3
1455,"It straightens my hair, but it also does pull it's a little more harsh than a normal hair brush",3
1463,It was okay should have purchased a different brand not the results I was expecting,3
1467,Difficulties setting up the right temperature is the only problem I encountered.  You actually need a protective glove due to the amount of heat generated.,3
1489,"I have coarse hair and it worked ok, but it took a lot of brushing and letting the brush reheating.",3
1495,No good on my hair to thick but works perfectly on my 6 year old guess I will keep,3
1505,"I haven't really noticed a difference, but it's a good moisturizer.",3
1512,No improvement for me and I would not get another one.  a bit oily.,3
1530,"I expected it to have a softer touch, and a nicer scent but it's okay.",3
1533,Fragrance is a bit strong for my liking and not sure my face feels/looks any different in the morning.,3
1564,"Very moisturizing, but just wasn't for me. It's not a bad product, it just wasn;t what I was looking for.",3
1584,It is as good as others moisturizing creams I have used.,3
1589,Product was okay not as good as I expected.  3 stars is a gererous review.,3
1601,"Super cute design, but extremely hard to bend in order to get a nice snug fit.",3
1607,Have to make adjustments as the fit is not right. Not as nice as pictured.,3
1640,I had to play with them for an hour because they were so floppy but it worked out just fine for my Kyubey cosplay,3
1676,Good size and thickness. Only issue is that it's difficult to clean the hair off of it (they stick to it very well).,3
1685,Cape is waterproof but the back is shorter than expected.,3
1686,Nice cape. But wish it were a little more water repellent,3
1700,It does not snap well around the neck. I would not recommend the product.,3
1710,It would be better if it were longer in the back.,3
1715,"Keeps the hair off good, but the hair seems to stick to it after the hair cut in spite of vigorous shaking.",3
1773,"Not powerful enough, just good for buffing feet after roughness is removed by a different method",3
1774,Product is okay.  I find the need to use it repeatedly to get cracked skin on heels off.,3
1782,I tried it on once. I need to fool with it more. I bought because I am a balding woman.,3
1784,it was okay. It did not fit to my head.,3
1790,"the jury is still out, they are too big for my daughter's hair, the color variety is not great.",3
1799,"Didn't care for the fragrance, leaves a tiny rash.",3
1821,"Super cute, but did not stay on as long as the Jamberry's do.",3
1825,Does not work on my skin. It's really thick and hard to apply. It also breaks me out.,3
1826,It's very thick and rich.  Very small for the price.  Feels really good on your skin.,3
1827,I had an issue with shipping but the company corrected it fast.  It's a little thick but other than that it's great.,3
1833,The string did not pull as tight as it was supposed to.,3
1842,Very cheap plastic easy to break and no way to fix and very itchy,3
1863,"It came and lots of the loops are coming undone
Other then that it's great",3
1864,"It was cute, but took about a month to arrive",3
1885,"Definitely a choker (a little too small), but it is cute.",3
1898,"Center stone was chipped. It was cheap, it was a gag gift.  I think it's good enough.  Too bad it's damaged.",3
1907,Some of the shells were broken when I got it. A lot lighter in weight than I expected. But overall it's very pretty.,3
1915,"smaller than what I expected, the deal was too good to pass up. Shells are thinner than expected, but arrived in tact.",3
1924,Fell apart. Two shells were actually already broken off when I received it.,3
1926,The metal rubbed off the ring and made a green stain on my finger. But it's truly beautiful.,3
1934,Cant really complain for the price but it has really sharp settings and the stone is crooked.,3
1937,"Very pretty, but the chain is cheap and broke the day I got it. So I cant even wear it",3
1940,"Pretty, but after couple days, the ""silver"" is already wearing off and turned my finger gray under the band.",3
1943,"While my grand daughter will love this, it is definitely ""chunky"" and looks rather like it came from a gumball machine.",3
1971,Great necklace for price but expect it to turn in coloring.,3
1972,Received 3 weeks early (yay!) But 2of the starfish charms are broken.,3
1994,Lost most of its silver color and left my finger green the first day I wore it.,3
2000,Beads are falling off and I have only taken it out of the package. Going to use it for a costume and it was only four dollars.,3
2002,"It's really pretty, but I ordered it 3/20 and got it 5/5!!!!!!  Really ridiculous..!!",3
2005,I love it but it got black so fast couldn't even enjoy ,3
2009,You get what u pay for but it's definitely a cute accent ring. Good for price,3
2016,Adorable ring but cheaply made. Broke in half after getting caught on something not 2 weeks after having it.,3
2036,"A very cute ring, however it started turning my finger green within a few days and the done coating was completely gone in a week. ...",3
2038,Lasted awhile.. I know it was cheap and it was going to look cheap and not last that long.. I loved it while I had it though.,3
2048,Cute but obviously not real gold. Typical inexpensive costume jewlery.,3
2052,Not great quality but for the price I paid its great.,3
2065,"You should buy this a size down, it was too big for my fingers so I have to wear it on my thumb.",3
2066,It's beautiful but after wearing for 2weeks it started turning to a brassy copper color.,3
2069,Looks great but silver came off after only a couple times of wearing,3
2073,"It's smaller then I expected!  Very pretty hope it won't tarnis, just received it yesterday",3
2092,It's a good case I just got it a bit scraped up and then the scraped up part got covered in tape,3
2099,"The mascara itself helps your lash get volumize, while the the other just don't help at all, and oh the fibers fall out ...",3
2110,"Not very happy with the product, nice shape but don't really work as stated.",3
2118,"Darker color than my dress, but I made it work by adding same color in church and on bouqet ribbon.",3
2123,"shaver bracket holds skinny handled razors, not fat handled shavers like mine.",3
2125,the product is just ok. looks cheap. was bent out of shape when delivered had to reshape.,3
2127,"Cup is rather small, had to cut my puck in quarters",3
2128,Shipping was great. Bowl is SMALL! Whole thing OK for the money. Razor holder too small for today's razors.,3
2174,Loved the package and aroma! But the powder itself isn't up to what it claims to do:(,3
2191,"Great price. The high frequency works fine. The steamer is not height ajustable, that's the only problem",3
2221,"Looks cheap. The hand is nice, but the chain is not a chain.... It's a long black string you tie and untie",3
2226,breaks easily and too big for my neck but i love the design but it broke within first week :'(,3
2231,"Not as short as I would have liked it to be, but still cute for the price paid.",3
2232,NOT A CHOKER. simply a necklace. Did not like the length of the chain,3
2237,"Okay. It was definitely not a choker on me. It also does not have an eye. Other than that, this necklace is amazing.",3
2249,No real difference although it is 2 dollars so no real complaints,3
2253,It doesn't work that much on me and it hurts very poor quality..,3
2260,Very streaky and patchy. It's better if you pat it on. It was too light for me.,3
2267,Love the smell.  Disappointed in the tininess of the bottles,3
2284,Product was not as described. I received clinique foaming facial soap - not the foaming sonic facial soap.,3
2291,Not as sparkly as I thought it would be I both sides but my girlfriend still adores it.,3
2307,It is moisturizing but I haven't noticed a difference In My dark eye circles.,3
2309,Lot of billing for this but it only works OK that's it.,3
2318,Worked like a charm at first but now is making my skin oily,3
2350,I have sensitive eyes and skin. Every time I use the product my eyes water.,3
2355,Only used it a couple of months. Probably need to use longer to notice a difference....,3
2358,I bought it because I always have bags and dark circles. I have not seen much improvement yet.,3
2368,"Doesn't really help with dark circles,wrinkles or puffiness but is a good moisturizer",3
2369,Very nice cream but I don't notice it doing anything for dark circles.,3
2377,"came in on time. so far it works fine, not sure i see much difference yet.",3
2379,"I haven't seen the results that it promises, but it I haven't it very long.",3
2392,It did nothing for me. My eyes felt heavily moisturized and some kind of minor reaction happened. Red skin bubbles had appeared under my eye area.,3
2398,I have been dabbing it on in the mornings after getting out of the shower. The product is not clearing up my  dark circles.,3
2403,I haven't noticed any difference however I don't use it daily like I should,3
2418,It's an ok moisturizer. Doesn't do anything for the bags under my eyes.,3
2421,i have been using it a few weeks and works good for puffiness and moisture but has not helped dark circles much,3
2429,Fairly good product.  Everyone must try it themselves to see their own results.,3
2430,it moisturize the area well however i haven't seen any improvement in the dark circles...i would recommend it as a makeup base or as a moisturizer,3
2432,I really need more time to make a judgment.....but am enjoying the product and looking forward to results.,3
2452,I've used it for a week and see no difference.  It does not reduce puffiness at all.  Three stars because it does not irritate skin.,3
2453,Purchased the product and it came half empty...already a bad sign  -___-,3
2459,I haven't had the product long enough to see if it helps.,3
2462,Some of the darker circles faded. But puffyneas still there.,3
2471,"No significant changes as of using it for less than a week, will post again after 2 weeks, 1 month, etc.",3
2498,Haven't seen a huge difference in weight loss but i feel it has mad my skin smoother and tighter,3
2500,Ok product kind of burn if you rub on skin too much. Haven't seen that much of a difference.,3
2516,"It has reduced some of the cellulite dimples, but not completely. However, because of the small improvement I would buy it again.",3
2524,Its pretty good quality. The plastic texture on the outside seems like it'll peel later. Its an average quality straightener.,3
2528,Came in a squashed box from over seas ........ Not what I really expected,3
2537,Got it for my cosplay and after washing and styling it it was perfect!,3
2548,Very slippery to hold when you have soap on them - wish handle was bigger,3
2582,Definitely a good combo and an improvement over my previous brands but not as good for my real dry over processed hair.,3
2588,"Good enough,  but mine is not leather. Looks like it but not",3
2596,Not a strong smell..does not last long in the shower.  Not worth the money,3
2626,I thought this was Large print.....not even close! I got to order a bible I can actually see to read.,3
2635,"At first the smell was a little strange but I got use to it.. bottle will last a long time. Its fine, nothing great",3
2656,"Looks great, the way it hooks in the back isn't ideal though.",3
2673,"great, but where do you find replacement wheel things?",3
2703,"Pros- It fits very snug on the tube.
  Comfortable on the cheek.
Cons-Needs to be shortened other your charging handle will hit the first 1/2"".",3
2707,A bit too big as in my charging handle scrapes across the top as I pull it back,3
2708,"EH... HOLLOW END IS UNFORTUNATE, I WILL BE BUYING SOMETHING ELSE, PRETTY CHEAP",3
2714,Only received 24 capsules in sealed bottle when it states 30 capsules. Will take what I got and see if they work,3
2715,Not sure about it.  Didn't see any difference.,3
2727,"This primer works well, but much like many others, dries out very quickly & becomes very thick.",3
2732,"The ""free"" item wasn't a serum.  It was patchouli oil.  I found that to be weird.",3
2735,Delivered on time. Been using product for a while. I see no difference,3
2744,this apron is well made but tiny! I wear a size 10 and this looks too small on me.,3
2746,"Like the look, but it seems to run small. I am a size 12/14 and it barely covers my chest.",3
2747,I liked this a lot while it lasted.  I got it in July and it's October and it has ripped already.  So 3 months.,3
2753,"It takes too long time to heat the wax, it is writen in manual heating time 30 min, but real time is 2 hours",3
2759,The only bad part is that it takes about 1 hour or more to heat the wax,3
2762,Too oily & not high quality...you could find better products elsewhere.,3
2764,Too early to tell if it will work or not.,3
2802,Don't see what all the fuss is about with Japanese cotton,3
2807,"This company adds stevia to all of the ""dusts"". I can't stand stevia so these are useless for me.",3
2809,"I received the good night dust as a sample. I definitely felt drowsy after drinking it, but I didn't care for the taste of it.",3
2846,"My dreads looked better for a little while, but all the hair that we wove back in using the lock sculpta came back out.",3
2868,"Pretty messy and a longer cord would be nice. Other than that, works fine",3
2883,"They could stand to be a little thicker to better cover tattoos, but I would still buy them again. Probably.",3
2889,"Product is great, just not what I was looking for.  Thank you.",3
2909,"a little goes a long way , but for the price there is not too much product",3
2926,The Make Up powder was a little too dark and a little too orange for me; I would have preferred a more pinkish/redish color.,3
2931,Just like I expected - and remember . But the big jar is deceiving. Not much product in it.,3
2945,I bought this but it's just not the same or maybe I remember it differently but nostalgic. . .,3
2957,"I was expecting a larger jar and quantity,  expensive for such a small amount",3
2961,The powder is fine as I have used this in the 70's.  The puff is no help at all because it is like a cotton ball.,3
2973,Adequate but not tall enough and a little short on my toes.,3
2999,A lot tighter than what it looks like shown here.,3
3005,I love the shape! but they are a little big for me and itchy.,3
3048,"It does fix your skin tone, but not skin shade",3
3056,"Ehh...Ive been using it over a month and I didn't notice any difference. If there was a difference, it wouldve been very little.",3
3066,Works well but the pump on mine is broke so I have to unscrew the lid to use it,3
3074,"Healthy Vibes Vibrant Bright All Natural did not work for me, but thank you!",3
3075,I didn't use the product for a long time maybe 6 days but i did see my under arms change to a different/ligher shade a little bit.,3
3079,Haven't really seen any difference after a couple months.,3
3081,still waiting to be lighter in nether region...:),3
3085,"It does work, but not as dramatic of a result that I would prefer.",3
3097,I used the lotion  for 3 weeks and no results.,3
3113,It doesn't truly feel as though it's an exfoliating loofah. It feels too soft to truly be doing any sort of real cleaning.,3
3124,"The material is better than the typical plastic scrubbie.  Unfortunately, there are loose threads hanging from the scrubbing surface that are unattractive and annoying.",3
3128,They're okay. Nothing spectacular. No better than the cheap ones at Walmart. WAY overpriced.,3
3131,Great product but the string falls off and therefore we can no longer hang them!,3
3138,It is much difficult to tell that it has dual sides as both sides seem to be the same to me.,3
3143,"They look really nice and fit most small wrists, but they do not stay on the arm, there is not enough connection.",3
3152,Great style size ....kind of fragile.... Had to reglue flower into ring,3
3157,It is really cool on but the ring change that connects it all fell apart. Worth the monies I paid for it!,3
3158,The price was right to go with a goth costume but they don't stay put. Was constantly fixing it on my hand all night.,3
3161,The item looked as described however it fell apart before I received it and still had hot glue on it,3
3167,As soon as I opened it the ring fell off..I had to glue it back on. But its still pretty!,3
3212,Nice addition to my hobby...cutting hair for fun.,3
3217,not much help. laying on it hurt after a bit.,3
3223,"Should be just bit bigger more the full round of the human head. You tend to ""fall off""
 of it while sleeping",3
3226,Just not comfortable like my original pillow.  Its too big for this ladies head!!!,3
3240,A little to thick and large to be comfortable on a pillow.,3
3241,Very expensive mostly due to the postage and it would have been helpful for it to have a washable cover,3
3265,The attachments don't all connect well but they still hold my wigs up fine,3
3267,kind of hard to keep together. little pink circle falls off everytime i pick the wigs up,3
3301,These work well but I find them a bit drying to the face.,3
3308,"They are OK, prefer Oil of O'lay these have a bit too much perferm smell for me.",3
3322,It's very weird thing. I consider it a lost of my money.,3
3326,Not what I had expected.  Design could be better to make this more effective,3
3335,I bought it as a gag - and it scared the dog.,3
3337,Couldn't figure out if I was doing it right; couldn't feel my muscles doing anything.  I have tiny lips.,3
3339,it was too big for mouths... couldn't fit...,3
3344,as a novelty item its OK. anyone serious about its use should note that all the instructions are written in Japanese.,3
3359,I used it only on my eyebrows. It doesn't really seem to make them grow. I wouldn't purchase it again.,3
3368,"like little shorter than short as closer length to natural lashes.  As for color I prefer 'brown'
do you even offer color brown?",3
3370,This did not do anything for me. I used it twice a day for 6 weeks. Not any changes at all.,3
3389,flimsy when compared with other removers purchased in the past but it gets the job done.,3
3402,The cover doesn't stay on. Sharpens well though.,3
3441,"very pretty, runs small around the neck. took a little longer than expected to come in the mail.",3
3483,"Bag was great, however the mirror was broken and it smelled like cigarettes",3
3484,Much smaller than I expected. It will be okay for small overnight trips.,3
3485,"Thought they would of been bigger. Bought one for me and one for my granddaughter, decided to give her both. Not big enough for me.",3
3486,"smaller than expected but ver cute, nice quality for the price, good for a few items.",3
3488,Very flimsy. Unable to stay up sturdy. Always collapsing.,3
3490,A little bit smaller than I expected it to be and there is not as much space inside the makeup bag,3
3496,Thought it was a bit of a hassle to use.,3
3499,"I like it, but its a little smaller than I thought",3
3500,"not as easy A Way to use, as I thought, with the 2 separate compartments. Good value though",3
3507,"This will be good for travel.  It's collapsible, 4"" x 3 1/2"" x 7"".  Not a heavy plastic.",3
3509,"The bag was much smaller than I had anticipated, but I managed to make it work for me.",3
3516,It did what they said it would do just requires a lot of work :/,3
3546,"Good product.  I like it, but watch the price because it fluctuates at times.",3
3560,A lot of the shades are similar of not the same.,3
3567,Not all of the colors shown on the outside of the pencil actually match the pencil color.,3
3577,I didn't get the colors shown.  I needed the bright colors and got all dull brownish colors.  Very disappointed.,3
3578,most of the colors are hot pinkish or redish only like 2 good beige and neutral tones,3
3583,Nice variety. My 7 and 9 year olds enjoy wearing them.,3
3589,"Great colors but the pencil is gone so fast, a lot goes a little ways..",3
3600,I was hoping for more red colors and not all of the brown ... but it's ok .. thank you ..,3
3612,"It takes me forever to get some real color on my lips, like lipstick.",3
3617,Just ok. A lot of the colors look the same.,3
3622,"Bleeds a bit after a while so it looks silly on my lips, colors are alright but I don't think I can use some.",3
3625,"Colors are lighter than what I expected, these colors will look better on people with lighter skin color.",3
3627,"Many color choices, but they fade/come off pretty easily.",3
3640,"Overall awesome , except the color variety is not there and one of the pencil didn't had the lid.",3
3646,"Very hard pencils. Good colors, but putting the colors on your lips is uncomfortable. Items should come with a sharpener, but they don't.",3
3650,I didn't even get the Italia liner I got a persistent lip liners? Pretty disappointed,3
3665,"Kind of funky shades, nothing near a neutral. Still a good bargain if you like to try orange/reds. Just doesn't work on my coloring.",3
3669,They are creamy and apply nicely...it's just that some of them have a strange old make-up smell to them.  I wouldn't repurchase.,3
3691,"The colors are too light for African-American women, unfortunately.",3
3728,"They smell bad as if they were old, pass the smell they are GREAT!",3
3747,"Most of them were in the pink red colors, was looking g for more variety of colors",3
3763,"Smell so good, all my clients love the fruity smell",3
3764,"Very good cualitativo but difficult to sharpen. Tip breaks while trying to sharpen and makes a mess, but really smooth and creamy",3
3774,"Colors are a bit on the bright side, don't seem to go with a variety of skin tones",3
3826,"Lots of colors look the same. But, they are pigmented and not too drying on your lips.",3
3844,"Nice variety of colors, but they are just okay.",3
3847,The colors are mostly brown. I wanted different colors but its just different shades of brown.,3
3852,"They are worth the price, even tho they have a slightly weird smell to them. Similar to crayons.",3
3867,All the colors have a red/pink hue.  I was hoping they'd be more neutral tones.,3
3870,Great matching colors however they are a lighter so need a lot of applications,3
3877,The quality was chalky and the colors were not as dark as I'd expected.,3
3887,"Love the colors, go on smooth and super pigmented but you get like 3 of each color. So really your only getting 4 different colors",3
3889,Good for the price but they don't stay on as long as I'd like but still good for the price.,3
3922,These are pretty great. Wish they came in more colors!,3
3927,"Love the colors, very good quality would buy it again.",3
3931,Half the colors were wearable. Gave half away. Goes on pretty smooth but a little heavy.,3
3958,"Good quality and lasts long, but requires more blending than I expected.",3
4001,Thought maybe the colors would be a bit lighter to medium.  Many are very dark.  Hoping for some lighter colors.,3
4004,"Love the colors and how smooth they apply.  The only bad thing, is they smudge after a while.",3
4008,"the colours don't match the colors on the outside of the pencil. and theres not much variety. only tones of pink, really.",3
4010,the color is the same !!! there's no nude or naked... just dark red and dark red and daaark reed (:,3
4016,Some of these are shorter than others. Not as shown.,3
4028,Colors goes well with my lipsticks. You get what you pay for. I receive all  12 pieces. Yes I would buy again.,3
4094,Thier ok. cant ask for more for the price I paid,3
4098,"does not last on lips very long, I expected longer lasting color",3
4119,"Pros: nice colors, very pigmented, goes on smooth

Cons: has a funny smell, some of the pencils are longer than others",3
4132,"It came just in time, but some of the pencils were shorter then the overs which was very disappointing",3
4148,Some colors are very strange...but I can find my perfect nude!,3
4191,"I didn't quite get the ""fast"" results I hoped for.",3
4205,I'm a dental hygenist and I luv this!! But the cord is super long ....,3
4207,The earrings are very pretty but the size was bigger than I expected. I have a small ears so they were a lil big,3
4211,top one had apiece missing butterflies was ok bottom one looked real cheal like the had been worn a lot,3
4213,Works great...took away the stink but not the wetness...,3
4228,Paste is good but still gives me irritation. I've been trying product after product but still have irritation and a rash,3
4237,3 stars for the idea and the natural ingredients but it didn't work for me. Guess the search continues!,3
4251,It works ok on me until the end of the work day when I change and need to put on the ad deodorant.,3
4257,"gave me a rash, but several deodorants do.  I'm still searching for one that doesn't",3
4281,"I like the idea of this, but trying to switch over from mainstream brands of deodorant was too hard.  It just felt so sticky.",3
4306,"I loved it, but had a nutty odor, not what I expected.",3
4307,"It has a smell to it, also its kinda greasy feeling and leaves my face feeling sticky. Probably will not buy again.",3
4309,Didn't do anything for my face but started using it on my sun spots on my arms and it has helped them!,3
4312,It did not do any harm to my skin but I bought it to clear up some scars which did not go either.,3
4342,Thought these were self moisturized. Too hard to walk in the socks when you have cream on your feet.,3
4343,Nice set for price.  brushes are a bit on the thin side.,3
4344,"some brushes had a lot of bristles come lose, it was annoying",3
4397,"I love that this is all natural.  It does tend to flake off during the day though, so you may just want to have it handy.",3
4409,"It flakes off sometimes and lands on my eyelashes, and is pretty difficult to put on straight.",3
4435,"Product is good, just think that for price it should come in 4 pack...",3
4441,Stencils are way too big for a normal face. But the compact is awesome!!,3
4443,"Great, but wished the stencils were plastic instead of wax paper so they could stay in place easier",3
4444,"its cream base. Its not working well for me, I have to go back and use my other power type eyebrow makeup.",3
4446,"It's okay, looks somewhat patchy. Wouldn't purchase again",3
4448,It does the trick. Not quite what I expected but it works.,3
4450,the stencils are not easy to use. shape is off.,3
4454,Not my favorite - still searching for a brow product to love.,3
4472,Does not match my skin tone. Used it once and got rid of it.,3
4497,A little coarse and a little too small. But useful for the feet.,3
4498,I loved the texture but the towel was WAY TOO SMALL!!  Was impossible to use to wash my back. Works well as a facial towel.,3
4508,The material is too hard for me! it is too strong for my body Exfoliating. but i use it for feet once a week.,3
4512,gave this to my sister just was my style just didn't look right,3
4515,It was good for a while but shortly after I wore it for about a week or two and it broke in half. :(,3
4521,Nice toe ring but gold wore off the 3rd time I wore it,3
4525,It's tiny and Cheap but it gets the job done and it's adorable,3
4527,No matter how small I make it it still shifts way to much and I cannot pinch it together to fit,3
4528,"I like it, but definitely after hitting water, it got rusty fast and made a greenish bluish tint on my toe",3
4551,They were falling apart when I opened them. Tear easily! They do feel nice and relaxing but not sure if they do anything.,3
4555,"It is not comfortable to use, but it does moisturize well",3
4559,The fragrance was fine in the first week but faded after,3
4561,Eh.....nice rich lather but not in any way a sandalwood scent.,3
4563,"I love sandalwood
 This soap has a great lathering sudsy texture, but it smells  softlyfloral , not like sandalwood",3
4565,Product was ok but little bit drying out my skin. Not ok for me. But smells ok.. and can use it for some time.,3
4570,"It's a very good quality of soap, but it left MY skin very dry and ashy",3
4575,Smells and looks great but totally dried out my hands :(,3
4589,"It smells awesome but it strips the skin of all moisture, not a fit replacement for Dove bar soap.",3
4608,"great smell, good lather, BUT you left to much of the rose stems in.........",3
4612,"This soap has grit in it, great for feet but not so much for face.",3
4616,Smells too soapy.  Overwhelms the smell of the sandlewood.,3
4637,I really don't care for the smells of these soaps. They last a long time though,3
4669,Bought originally to use in my face but left me dry so now I use as a hand soap.  LAsts a very long time,3
4693,"Leaves soap scum everywhere, but it's really skin softening",3
4767,Smells good but ordered a size too large to fit into my glass soap container for the countertop.,3
4769,"Too scented to use as body soap. Instead, I use it for items that need to be handwashed.",3
4796,"This soap is very moisturizing to the skin.  I really like it, but wish I would have bought it with a fragrance.",3
4823,"The soap is great, I use it all the time but this bar is too small for the price.",3
4838,"Like the soap, smell is ok, I think I prefer a different fragrance, this one was flowers.",3
4847,Smells great but you can get bigger bars at TJ Maxx for less. This is the size of a standard bar of soap.,3
4865,"Nice soap, but honestly, TJ has more variety and better prices for same.",3
4867,"Love the soap brand, but didn't like this particular scent.",3
4871,A nice smelling bar soap but it is not one I will purchase again because it seems to dry my skin out rather than moisturize it.,3
4912,"Bars are too big, even cut in half size is awkward. Oval or round & half the size would be about right...",3
4932,The soap itself is nice however it smells nothing at all like coconut which is disappointing.,3
4968,It lasts long but I am not a fan of the smell.,3
5013,"A previous reviewer is right--smells just like old tires in hot sun. Works fine, however.",3
5016,"way too expensive for what you get, decent soap but nothing special",3
5023,Really like the quality of this soap but not the fragrance of this scent.,3
5030,I figured this soap would be exceptional due to the reputation & price but I wasn't that impressed.  It's not bad but not worth the cost,3
5047,It's a little too big. It won't stay in my soap holders.,3
5048,A little hard to handle due to its size.  It won't fit my soap holders.,3
5098,Smells OK but gritty.  I won't buy this again.,3
5109,This soap is nice but the scent is not as strong as I would have liked.,3
5121,"Smells pretty good, but doesn't last too long. I think ours lasted about 3 weeks.",3
5132,It's okay if you don't mind pieces of tree bark falling into the tub and needing to be coaxed down the drain!,3
5233,"smells okay, but made for  a lumberjack's hand!  will have to cut it down in order to hold on to it in shower.",3
5279,Review heading says it all. I liked how it smelled but didn't use it often since it dried up my skin.,3
5290,but I prefer the larger bars and will purchase those again if they have it.  I like this product but prefer more soap.,3
5344,"Nice for the price!  Stylish, actually its a better quality than I'd expected.  Received really fast.",3
5345,Cheaply made and lock fell of the bracelet as soon as it came out of the package.,3
5353,It's way too big. For my tiny hand. But love those coins charms.,3
5357,My wife uses it and she said it feels good. She tried it a few times but don't really see a big differences,3
5359,Don't leave it on to long. It makes my eyelid itching,3
5363,Turns skin white and powdery. Otherwise it works well.,3
5367,"I suppose it works fine, but I really don't like the salty feeling on my skin.",3
5369,"This helps with pain but  it burns my skin , also the bottle was very oily when i opend the package",3
5370,"Burned the skin on my back, but no issues on my wife's skin. If you are sensitive to mag, think twice",3
5387,It is so itchy when you put it on and the stay leeks so now the bottle has magnesium all over.,3
5429,"Not quite the color I expected, but it will do.",3
5431,"It's beautiful, but it sheds. I don't think it will last a month. I haven't even combed it. HaHa",3
5449,Does not really work good but it's cheap and cute. I got a green one.,3
5454,"I like, but expect a pink panda and you sent me an ugly mustard :(",3
5462,"Bottles were a little smashed, but solution is good.",3
5465,I wasn't sure what to rate this because it doesn't help with aches and pains but the scent is amazing so I still use it.,3
5472,It help some of d pain...it relaxes d muscles ...,3
5488,this is a very nice brush but it was to wide for my intended purpose,3
5492,A seam split after first time using it.  Cheaply made.,3
5494,Pockets were smaller than I expected and zippers open both ways.,3
5500,"I love this roll up cosmetic case, but it didn't last long at all, the plastic ripped at the sewed seems. ",3
5507,Didn't really notice any difference when using or not.,3
5529,"First time using rose hip oil.  I don't believe it is very moisturizing, just oily. Doesn't irritate my skin,no harsh smell",3
5532,I jusf started usinw it. I can't really give a good rating until after a few weeks.,3
5545,"I love this color, but the shipping took a REALLY long time.",3
5550,"dont see any difference yet, hope i will if i keep using it daily",3
5580,"Inexpensive, but does not have as much cushion as in the picture.  Stitching quality is poor to fair.  Will work for occasional use.",3
5585,Not what I was expecting the band is a little snug and don't think it will help with my poor circulation...,3
5591,A little cheesier version of the Strutz brand of (fabulous!) arch supports,3
5598,"These look much like other more expensive arch supports, but the pads go flat rather quickly.",3
5602,"They're a little snug, but I'm sure they will stretch and be okay.  Thanks.",3
5604,"This product worked somewhat alright on my eyelashes, but did nothing at all for my eyebrows.",3
5616,"I LIKE IT BUT IT IS SOMEWHAT SMALL AND ITS A X-LG WHICH I WEAR.
BUT LIKE I SAID ITS SNUG FIT.",3
5619,Really big and clunky. Falls off and is hard to manage. It is pretty but not for long wear (aka wedding).,3
5622,These are very cute. The product inside is very very lightweight. So mostly it's for fun. Not Chapstick.,3
5628,"It's alright, not too harsh. Probably won't buy again.",3
5635,To be honest this didn't meet my expectations since I love the toner but this cleansing foam I feel like it didn't do anything.,3
5648,"These products felt nice on my skin and seemed good quality, but I saw no improvements in my pores and acne got mildly worse",3
5657,You have to have a small wrist to wear this.,3
5665,"For the price, the item is should have been much more sturdier.  Cheap looking.  Slightly disappointed.",3
5683,Not long enough and too bright. Silver looks better.,3
5685,I loved the necklace online--but in person the chain looks cheap-almost like it's spray painted. At least I didn't pay a lot.,3
5687,"The necklace was okay
I did not like the chain that was on it.",3
5778,Seems watered down but not sure if it's normal to be that way,3
5782,I love the smell.  I see absolutely no difference in the volume of my hair after using this product.  A waste of money for me.,3
5797,Doesn't hold very well but i do like the brush,3
5813,Product wouldn't come out of the tube not sure if it is just old or too thick. Couldn't use it sorry.,3
5816,I was not disappoint when receiving the Banggood Waterproof Lady Girl For False Eyelashes Thank  you .. Amazon,3
5825,"The tube leaks, not happy about that! But the past itself is not terrible, the taste doesn't last that long though",3
5828,"Its good, but a tiny part of the tube ripped open when i was squeezing it to use it.",3
5837,Pretty good just it took a month for it to ship,3
5866,Great product but dis not realize how small the bottle was,3
5885,I only used it once a day and it dried up my piercing so..,3
5905,"This piercing solution does it's job when it comes to cleaning, but I can't stand the strong scent of tea tree oil.",3
5906,"Nice product, not sure what value it has over a warm saline mix which I can make at home",3
5930,"I was hoping this would help sooth my piercing bump, but it didn't. It's still very nice for cleaning the piercing, though.",3
5932,"It worked ok I guess. Somedays it looked like it was healing, other days not so much.",3
5952,"painful to put on,  opening to small, have to start at top of ear and work it down",3
5958,I wold have rated it higher if it was made of metal,3
5961,"Does provide texture and volume, but no better than what I can get from a cheaper product. The smell is perfumey, but nothing too offensive.",3
5962,"I need volume, and this product does work for me.  I am always looking for something better.",3
5977,I think this would work best on thin or short hair... mine is long and thick!,3
5989,Not crazy about it but other people I know that use it love it so it's probably just me.,3
5995,Makes my hair sticky.  Not sure if it really helps with volume.,3
6001,Its awkwardly sized... I wish it was a little smaller.,3
6008,"Not bad, esp. for a dollar. However, my hair is thin and fine and it keeps sliding out.",3
6014,"Holds my hair, but the quality is not that great",3
6028,Very cute necklace. Bought it for vacation and I loved it!,3
6032,Really pretty design! Gave 3 stars because when you really take a look at it looks very flimsy.,3
6039,"Cute, but not great quality.  It started to rust within the first few weeks.",3
6046,"Chain is very thick and it is too big for my neck. I'll probably wear it, but it was not what I was expecting.",3
6063,"Did not fit my shoes, great product, but I couldn't use them for what I needed them for",3
6100,"I alright did really make a difference in my hair, but seems great.",3
6114,This hair serum is nothing special. I wouldn't buy it again.,3
6124,Makes hair stiff and a bit sticky. Tedious to apply. Small quantity for price. Sticking to sprays or powders dispensed from bottles from now on.,3
6129,Weird texture. Took too long to put on. Wound up throwing away as I like the spray ones better,3
6137,"5 stars for the product, great lipstick and wonderful color. However the vendor/transaction was 2 star at best. Delivery was super late...",3
6139,Great color but it doesn't last as long as I wish it did.,3
6140,Not the color i expected but i have bought other colors from this brand and have no complains.,3
6145,It's kinda drying God help you if you put too much on and don't forget to scrub your lips,3
6149,"Only 3 stars because nice color, but never stayed on.  Not even a half hour.",3
6150,Pretty color but your lips feel super dry. I had to wear petroleum jelly on top which defeats the matte purpose.,3
6155,I love this but the color looks NOTHING like selling photo,3
6162,color is lighter and I did have to apply a few times a day,3
6164,Looks good when you first put on. Very dry and comes off in weird spots. It has a glittery look to it I wasn't expecting.,3
6170,Kept falling out in all sizes but does change your nose shape nicely,3
6193,The nail clippers are the best but only got one but was compensated for the other,3
6207,Only one came in not two. But I don't really care,3
6218,way larger than i thought very nice item just a bit on the large side for me,3
6252,I notice a little difference when using this product but nothing significant.,3
6256,"Not seeing a huge difference. But yes, it is working a little bit.",3
6269,Not sure  I like this product.  I tried it once or twice and have not used it since.,3
6296,Very cute and decent quality but will not stay put on my head.,3
6314,"This is a bit expensive for no noticeable improvement in my wrinkles, small or otherwise.  Have used it for several months but will not be reordering.",3
6331,"Not particularly impressed with this item, I won't purchase again.  My face broke out with bumps .",3
6347,"Nothing got worse, didn't see anything got better.",3
6350,Cream is a bit oily. It leaves a shine on my face. I have oily skin and this has added more shine to my face.,3
6351,Used for several weeks with no noticeable difference in skin.  Does not absorb well.,3
6355,"I do not like the perfume scent of the face cream, but the serum does make your skin feel smooth.",3
6370,This product made my face to oily. And my face broke out.,3
6379,nice but haven't noticed it being any better than the rest on the market. pricey,3
6394,It's OK....  too expensive for the amount in the jar...  make it yourself!,3
6406,Very pretty and comfortable except one piece fell out on the first wearing,3
6410,"Arrived with a few of the jewels missing.  Not a huge deal, but for the price, should come intact.",3
6418,"They look amazing, just hard to keep
Them nice and soft",3
6422,"Nicely packaged but the color was not what I was expecting. Sadly returned, but I would consider buying again if there were more colors.",3
6426,Not what I excepted.  Looks like a toy hair piece.,3
6429,its ok for the price you pay for.... it is a little bit sticky,3
6445,"I like them, but it leaves your lips really sticky and sometimes they can get really chapped. Awesome colors though!",3
6482,Is cushiony but suction cups need improvement. Very difficult to get to stick to tub. Have to really press hard.,3
6483,"Quick delivery, even on a Sunday. Came clean, wrapped in plastic. Suction cups do not work at all in my tub but still useful.",3
6522,There okay. I should have paid closer attention to the diameter. Little too large in scale for a 9 year old.,3
6542,"Quality was not as good. Then again, it's for cosplay.",3
6558,"It's a nice color, but it's kinda transparent. They accidentally shipped 3 tubes instead of 1, but I'm not complaining.",3
6559,The color is definitely not a hot red or even a true red. It goes on pink.,3
6568,This product works as advertised. My issue is that it does not create a good lather with body wash like a traditional loofah.,3
6601,Meh it does what it should but nothing special. In retrospect I would have probably been happier with the handle type loofah.,3
6619,not bad for the price...could have been a little longer.,3
6653,The Loofah is not thick enough to get the job done; a brush/Loofah on a long handle would be better,3
6673,"Worked fine, just not enough product for the price.",3
6674,I really wanted to like this but it made me break out :-(,3
6675,Works good but doesn't come out in a nice way.  Very liquidy. I won't get it again.,3
6679,unfortunately the bottle was dropped and didn't get the opportunity to use it.,3
6686,using for a long time like more than an hour i get stuffy nose all the time.,3
6734,Took them fishing and did a good job keeping the bugs away. It's quick and doesn't have the strong smell of a spray,3
6740,Worked great the first 20 mins or so. Then just on the arm it was being worn on . Other arm got bit up!,3
6748,it works ok but might only last about 6 hours each bank you have on,3
6760,We have tried once with these bracelets and it may not work well since we all got quite some mosquito bites,3
6761,Not sure that these actually worked but the kids loved wearing them!,3
6763,I am not sure how well this worked for us. We were always getting bit.,3
6775,Not sure it is effective.  I will not purchase again.,3
6777,"These didn't as well as we hoped. To be fair, the bugs were worse than usual.",3
6789,They seem to work okay ... they just get a little itchy after wearing for awhile.,3
6795,"They worked but very flimsy, and do not last as long as other bands.  For the amount of bands and price they are ok.",3
6808,I got bit on the arm I wasn't wearing the band.,3
6817,Product works great if you only have a few bugs around but if they are thick then it doesn't keep them away.,3
6820,They work but you need to use 4. One for each extremity.,3
6832,"Still getting bit with these on, although maybe not as much.  The search continues for repellents that really work.",3
6843,"The latex is really watered down and thin in consistency, however works well for brush on applications.",3
6853,Too watery and takes too long to dry even when using a dryer.,3
6891,"Its pretty thick and somewhat hard to manipulate and work with, but for playing around and doing simple gore sfx it is what I payed for",3
6938,It was good but a little hard to peel off and smelled very strong compared to other products that I bought before,3
6944,It was thinner than other latex I have used and was too thin to use for scars.  Better as an adhesive,3
6983,This product is very thin. Tkaes a while to dry.,3
6990,Mostly just runs down.  So watery as to be useless,3
7004,The stem is too short. Only about 6 inches long. Otherwise it was fine,3
7017,"If the color had been true to picture and had a better backing, this would have gotten a better rating",3
7021,I love the earring but they did not come with the little clippers that Secure the back of the Earring  ,3
7035,"Very simple and dainty earrings. Earrings r 3 separate pieces, as shown in the picture.",3
7040,"one came in bent, turned colors on second day of wear, don't want to give bad rating",3
7053,"Dainty and unusual earrings, very pretty, very good price.",3
7056,"Was pretty, but the beads from falling out!!!",3
7058,The product is kinda cute but low quality but hey got it with discounted price. Thanks,3
7062,It arrived on time not a bad product just not as strong as I was hoping,3
7063,These bands are so cute when worn.  3 stars as some of the bands are loose.,3
7065,they are great for the price. Not really meant for anything but little girls hair though. works great on my three year old.,3
7088,"Very strong, no instructions to dilute, and didn't come with a free gift. Very disappointed by the free gift exclusion.",3
7094,Synthetic taste. I haven't tried all 10 that I ordered & will re-review if my experience changes.,3
7110,Product quality wasn't as per expectations but you get what you pay for. Fast shipping.,3
7129,They aren't long enough to fit into my piercing AND put the O ring on.,3
7131,"The doughnuts fall off too easy, other than that they are greaf!",3
7133,They were as expected. Unfortunately  they didn't stay in place very long.,3
7146,this just arrived I will writte my review in a couple days,3
7155,Doesn't get rid of the fungus but hoping it stops it from growing,3
7163,"Great for pedi but not tough enough for mani - discoloration on nails is clearing up after using this brand exclusively for about 8 weeks.
Jen C",3
7181,The colors are nice in the bottle but not on my lips,3
7184,"It takes a while to dry and its a sticky consistency. Once it is dried, the color stays on for most of the day.",3
7187,"Vibrant colors, but feels sticky on lips even after applied for 20+ minutes. Would not buy again.",3
7189,I liked these color gloss. They look nice and they are durable. You can wear them mate or put a shine to it as well.,3
7205,They did not last too long! Broke fairly easily! The only good thing is that my daughter loves them.,3
7208,OK.  Doesn't take the static out of my hair completely.,3
7232,"GREAT FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO LOOK PALE, I MYSELF WASNT EXCITED. I MIXED IT WITH ANOTHER COLOR TO TRY TO GET IT RIGHT",3
7240,I received 2 cover rose and 1 cover pink no beige,3
7263,Is too sensitive and stop when I pass in my foot.,3
7265,"This works ok.  It does leave my skin smooth, but does not remove the dead skin.  after a day or so it feels rough again.",3
7272,Not much power.  Doesn't do any better or worse than any other callus remover.,3
7273,Doesn't seem to take care of the callus removal but good idea product.,3
7275,it doesn't seem to work as well as I was expecting it too. Doesn't seem to have enough power,3
7294,This is ok. Takes time to remove callus. Not so effective as I expected,3
7314,"Removes dead skin, but doesn't really leave skin smooth. Wish it worked with more pressure to really remove dry, flaky skin.",3
7316,"Really good product if you have fairly soft feet. Guess i needed more like a sander for my
Jacked up feet.",3
7340,"could use a little more power, but overall it does what it says",3
7358,A couple pieces had fallen off in the package before I opened it.,3
7365,Very clumpy and does not stay on as long as one expects. Comes out patchy. Colorpop provides a much better product.,3
7401,"It works to get the job done. The nail file is a joke though, buy some glass files separately and replace.",3
7410,"Two of the items were non-functioning, but the folks at Bixore were kind enough to replace the scissors and the clippers for me, no charge.",3
7411,I mainly bought this for the clippers and the clippers are bad quality. Impressed by the emory board.,3
7414,Will be great for travel or to carry in my purse.,3
7431,Much smaller than I was expecting.  I should have red the reviews more carefully because it does describe the size.,3
7433,"A bit big and slide off my face, I need to adjust the ear part and probably add something so it won't fall.",3
7447,I feel like it washed out already and it's only been 4 weeks,3
7460,Works good enough. Kind of large and can't get to smaller ares in middle of ball of foot where calluses are worse.,3
7477,its cute but a little too expensive for a small sheet,3
7520,"They work ok, but some of the designs are not as clear as others when you stamp them.",3
7553,Disappointed in the size. But that's definitely might fault for not checking the dimensions of the product. I assumed they were going to be bigger,3
7557,it was SUPER SPARKLY and they did not rally match my skin tone.,3
7574,"Medal hinge wasn't set, and I couldn't fix.",3
7588,No instructions whatsoever. I honestly have not even tried them yet,3
7594,It's OK if you don't be very careful you can get a bad cut. The level is off my hair was cut uneven.,3
7596,Its a little harder to use than advertised. but its ok when you have help.,3
7610,Very cute but I wish it would show up a little better.,3
7612,It is just OKAY I don't like it too much but it's fine I guess,3
7614,"It's streaky and took off my foundation, however it was a great eye primer made my eyeshadow stay on for hours.",3
7635,Doesn't show up as well as powder. Doesn't seem to stay too lomg. Pretty when first applied though. Very golden,3
7638,"really only for very fair skinned people. it looks nice, but also gets kind of cake-y",3
7644,"wouldn't recommend, doesn't apply nicely on top of foundation",3
7652,"It's not as bright as I had hoped, but it is nice.",3
7657,It's a pretty good product. I was expecting something a little different but over a a pretty darn good product,3
7699,I have this thing for a while and still waiting when it's gonna work.,3
7709,There was no foam and they weren't textured the Same as buff puff.,3
7712,They work reasonably well.  Price was definitely great.  Will buy again.,3
7720,Its more of a burgundy color but I liked it so it was fine.,3
7721,Came way early which was nice. But I wanted BLACK and got PURPLE,3
7744,"The product itself was great, but the individual units were a little small. Great for creating gift packs, or family trips!",3
7748,I paid $ 34 when I purchased it  but now  it is $ 24...I  liked this soothing gel though,3
7781,"Dissapointed:/ So pretty, but it broke after a week.",3
7793,"It does look just like the picture, but after only a week it broke off and I tried reattaching it but it still fell apart.",3
7802,I like the feel and texture but I did not like the scent.,3
7808,"A bit sticky,  likely because of the lanolin.  I only use it for air travel.",3
7876,"Very fragrant but rather small. Maybe it should be advertised as ""Mini Bombs"".",3
7882,"These smell all right, they sure look pretty in the bath water though.",3
7883,"these were crumbly when they arrived and some broken, they did the job though i wish they were ""fresh""",3
7894,Relaxing and smells good but otherwise very expensive for what you get.,3
7896,"Smaller than expected, and didn't really make the bath smell strongly or change colors. Just alright.",3
7912,"They were much smaller than the picture led me to believe.  One particular limit of online shopping, sometimes you get what you don't expect.",3
7926,"The bangs are too long and cap seems a little crazy, it will require some work but the colors are great!",3
7931,Wig shown was not what I received. But the wig I did get was workable. Was pretty much completely blonde. No other colors.,3
7933,I found the lipstick terribly drying and had to apply a moisturizing coat over it. The color was good and as expected.,3
7981,Hard to understand how to use better off doing a braid urself but great shipping,3
7985,I can see how this would work but my daughters hair is fine and thin so it doesn't work for her. ,3
7987,"It can help a friend to do your hair for you, but it is not easy to use on your own hair",3
7998,As pictured. I'm still trying to figure out how to keep it from poking out of my hair at the top.,3
8000,"its nice, i know how to braid, thought this would make the braid tighter but it feels odd, more than anything.",3
8001,"This only comes with two pieces. The directions weren't really that good. However, once you figure it out, it does work as stated.",3
8002,I am quite sure once I take the time and learn how to use it,3
8008,i couldn't get this this thing to stay in my nose. it really needs a backing,3
8016,"Poufs are a little smaller than I expected, but they do the job.",3
8020,They fall apart pretty fast. Probaly why they come in packs of three.,3
8037,Not as great as all the youtube hype but works.,3
8042,"Did not have smooth ends, so they're a little rough on my hair, but they hold a bun in place all day.",3
8047,"Great price, but the paint chips off the black ones easily and the lighter colored ones tarnish or something and change colors.",3
8051,It works but i don't like the smell in it,3
8052,Not what I was expecting it's really sticky and you have to wait awhile till you can peel it off,3
8056,This lipstick stays on for a very long time but the color is hideous. It's more like a hot pink rather than a rose pink.,3
8064,Super messy and you have to be precise not to get it on your skin. Will stain your skin,3
8069,"The product color is more like a fuschia-strong pink, definitely not what my daughter was expecting.",3
8074,Really messy.. But if you know how to work it then it's alright.,3
8087,does not last as long as the other but doesn't taste bad,3
8096,It's a good product it's just too sticky gets all over my teeth ..,3
8097,"It was alright, I had to apply it often would not stay on, don't put on if you have dry lips though peeling will hurt!",3
8099,nice colour but rubs of quite easily not as good as berrisome but okay for the low price,3
8102,It seems to always stick onto my lips a bit to harshly. The skin on my lips sometimes gets pulled.,3
8122,Smells good and was shipped quickly. Yet to see if it is productive. Will update again.,3
8123,Good product. But the bag came almost empty 3oz the most.,3
8140,Not as moisturizing as I expected. I have dry skin type and this product is definitely not made for me,3
8142,Not what was expected after 3 weeks of using. Still have break outs and some scars showing.,3
8153,"Made me breakout, but I do have sensitive skin.",3
8158,Its alright but too perfumed and not sure it helps with moisturizing,3
8162,it makes my face feel SUPER dry and streched out after i use it....,3
8171,"Of the many face cleansers I've used out of Korea, this one probably helped prevent breakouts the least.",3
8177,"For me it did nothing. It has a great scent, I really like that. I did return it.",3
8189,"Great price, lathers up nicely but leaves an interesting, not necessarily soft texture to the skin upon rinsing. will continue to use and see any changes/benefits",3
8201,"The product is really good, but it's already opened :((",3
8230,I do not know why it makes my face very dry. Unlike the mask makes your skin more moisture.,3
8233,It is ok... Not as good as toners from kiehl's and Origins... But it smells nice!,3
8254,"This product is ok. One of the bottles was
Broken when I got the package. It was a mess.",3
8260,They spray for awhile then you have to fight with it to continue to spray. Very frustrating.,3
8270,"Works well enough out of the box, but only came with 2 spray heads",3
8274,I like this but it is a pain in the ass to remove and my skin is always bright red and it makes a mess in my sink,3
8293,works just like it should but my hair is really long and i have to do half of a strand and then the other half,3
8297,didnt work as well on my thin hair. Worked very well on my sisters thick hair,3
8323,I like it. Shipping was HORRIBLE! Weeks late and I thought it was going to be late for Christmas present. Color had chip broken off.,3
8348,Don't want to say bad things but you need practice .Getting harder for me to put on.,3
8366,"Great quality wig , but beware the color it is marked as a black brown wig but it's more of a bright red brown in sunlight",3
8374,Beautiful colors  Chips long before I'd expect it to.,3
8375,I got the wrong colors. I ended up getting two shades of red and no black which I needed.,3
8385,"The scent is kinda foul, maybe because I am pregnant but its not that pleasing. The product itself is thick and I like it!",3
8388,Although they did not go away completely I definitely did notice a difference. They seemed more smoothed out and faded.,3
8392,"Very moisturizing. It helps the appearance of stretch marks by moisturizing the dried pulled skin deeply, but probably does not remove long term",3
8414,Not as good as some of the other brands that are more expensive. Other people may have better luck.,3
8426,The previous eyelash serum I used provided a fuller look.,3
8433,I have been using daily for 5 weeks now and do not notice a difference in my eyelashes at all.,3
8439,"I'm sure it will take a while to show some results, will update if longer lashes are noticed",3
8441,Haven't seen a big difference unfortunately. I waited to post until a month or more passed to see any results and Im not seeing much.,3
8449,I'm at 7 weeks and my lashes MIGHT be a little fuller but aren't longer.,3
8454,I'm okay with the eyelash growth serum but not impress,3
8456,I have HORRIBLE lashes and I'm sorry to say I really don't think this helped.,3
8457,I haven't noticed any difference and I apply it as directed.,3
8466,I keep going back and forth about whether or not this is working but I like to think it is,3
8468,I was skeptical but after one bottle there was noticeable difference . I would recommend using this  with other products to enhance the effect.,3
8471,Didn't do the trick. I thought it made my formerly Latisse lashes less visible. :( Wouldn't recommend.,3
8474,I'm still waiting for the results. Have not noticed any changes yet.,3
8475,Been using product and haven't noticed a difference yet.,3
8478,"I've been using the product for a few weeks, but haven't noticed a difference in my lashes yet.",3
8480,"I see improvement in my lashes, but not much. It took a while to notice difference.",3
8483,"not sure yet, it's been 3 weeks and I see no difference",3
8485,Used this for 6 weeks but didn't see any change in eyebrow growth.,3
8487,It's been two weeks and I haven't seen any results yet. Will keep trying.,3
8489,I am using it during the day but still haven't noticed any lash growth.  I'll wait to see results.,3
8490,I haven't noticed any change yet in my eye lashes. It's only been about 2 weeks.  If results change I will update my review.,3
8521,It's ok...notice some  regrowth not much.. Probably won't buy again,3
8522,"It hurts my eyes after I put them on my eyelashes. They goes into my eyes through the eyelashes, be careful everyone",3
8524,I have only been using it for 15 days so I have not seen any difference.  From the reviews it seems to take about a month.,3
8528,I've been using this product for over a week and have not seen any results yet..,3
8531,It's only been 2 weeks so there hasn't been a noticeable difference but I will continue using it & review again in a few weeks.,3
8533,"At this time, I am not seeing any progress! I have followed all instructions and feel concerned I wasted my money!",3
8538,"My eyelashes look stunning, a slight irritation after use.",3
8554,"Expensive and comes in a very teenie weenie container. So far, my eye lashes have not grown any extra length.",3
8561,Do not know yet id it will work. Some mold lid irritation that dissapates.,3
8571,Haven't seen any progress as of yet and have been using for week. Will review again when i see a difference.,3
8577,"I always buy my extensions from Sally's, these are so thin and skinny to look real. The truth is you get what you pay for.",3
8600,These are ok to add volume but to thin at the bottom. I had to cut off about 2 inches,3
8605,"They are the right color, bkends n my hair perfectly. However, they are very thin and i have thick hair.",3
8623,Great for lightweight items like stockings but not strong enough for long term (think 2-3 days) hold.,3
8647,"not bad, but seems extremely small.  hardly fits over my lady parts! too lazy to return so i'll regift it.",3
8649,"Cute but we returned it.  It's too short, definately for a petite woman.",3
8650,They're super cute but changed colors within a week.,3
8658,"Soft scrubber. Ok, but odd. Get back. Hard to reach area.",3
8664,Too stretchy to get any meaningful scrubbing going on. I have to fold it in half to get it to work the way I want.,3
8684,Love this product but it froze in my mail box Im hopeful the spray does not bust.,3
8724,Received in a timely manner. Well packaged. Scent too strong. Doesn't really smell like eucalyptus.,3
8735,"These are very tasty cookies and they were well packaged, but somehow they still ended up as pieces of cookies.",3
8737,Looks super cute but irritated and infected my bellybutton so i can't even wear it.,3
8739,This was a bit of an over sized belly right. After 2-3days it broke in half. I was very disappointed.,3
8740,Stones are a little big to gaudy. Wish it was a little more dainty.,3
8745,It was my favorite one but it broke easily :/,3
8746,So pretty! But breaks so easily...buying another one because it's so cute...hopefully this one lasts longer!,3
8755,3 stars because this came in as black not eggplant.,3
8756,"It does what it's supposed to do. Not fancy, color black. Nothing special",3
8757,It's nice but not as padded as I thought it was going to be,3
8771,It is the Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 that gives the great results but can be found in much less expensive products.,3
8780,"The wrap is not so useful, it is too thin and it doesn't fast.",3
8810,"Cute but hurts anywhere you put them, cartilage or not.",3
8814,Theyre skinnyer than I thought and the black. Two of the pinks I got were broken. But they were still pretty good,3
8827,"Love love love these, however they are all a bit too big for me to use. But, great quality.",3
8840,"They are not bad, one end pinches a little but I expected that. Overall I like them, they look like I have a real piercing.",3
8846,cute fun better then actually piercing yourself no one would know the difference!,3
8857,nice colors but they don't last long starts cracking in couple of days,3
8868,"Polish is decent quality, but the color match is a little off.",3
8876,Very thick polish. Much thicker than the sensationail brand. This made it difficult to apply without getting it all over my cuticles,3
8878,"product is as discribed,,,,however it took 2 months to arrive.  disappointed.",3
8886,"Colors are not as advertised. This is supposed to be the darker color, instead it looks brown with a hint of purple.",3
8893,I love love the colors they are very vibrant.  However the polish is really thick and hard to get an even coat on the nail.,3
8899,Only last between 7 to 9 days like the most.,3
8910,Peels easily . The colors I wished I could have picked each one individually the sets they have to choose from don't have all the colors I like,3
8912,They do not last that long and takes up at least three coats to make it opaque. Overall it good though.,3
8925,Don`t see much changes. Better then nothing - but it`s not a miracle product.,3
8928,Been using for about 2 weeks and I have NIT noticed any difference,3
8939,"Not enough product to tell difference, probably would have to buy 5",3
8945,The mixture comes out of the tube in a burst and is watery..,3
8961,These are great in theory... but my powders always break. They slide around because the magnetic tape ons do not stay.,3
8988,File is ok but arrived with part of pink area broken off (jagged break so I had to tape it to avoid cutting myself).,3
8992,"It is a little too thick for my liking.  Was as presented, just not for me.",3
8995,"Case often comes apart in my purse, file works okay.",3
9008,It's just a natural smelling oil. I would not say it has anything to do with weight loss.,3
9017,"The tassel fell off after a few times of wearing it. Otherwise, very pretty!",3
9023,I ordered this item on June 7th and received it on the 18th. Ths design is ok but it's cheaply made and small.,3
9025,Thinner & smaller than I expected but okay for the price,3
9027,Cute and very reasonable price but it turned color on me about a month later. I was disappointed on that part.,3
9046,Very pretty on but after a few months it becomes Rusty and smells,3
9049,bit cheap and was not as long nor hang on neck as pictured,3
9052,I love the necklace. Only 3 stars because it discolored.,3
9054,"Very pretty design, but the ""gold"" turns pretty quickly.",3
9062,"This was a cute necklace, not very good quality as it broke after 3 wearigs, also the colors were not natural looking.",3
9076,it's a really cute necklace.  up against clothing it looks really nice.,3
9082,"For the price is is cute, but not durable. It broke the 2nd time wore it and is already turning my skin green ",3
9086,"These spray bottles are more for looks than function. The spray is pretty week, and with minimal use, they seem to keep losing power.",3
9092,"I use this for spraying at my cat if she misbehave. After using it for a week, the spray stopped functioning....Very disappointed.",3
9104,I am not sure if I saw result but it does not irritate my skin.,3
9108,stays in place. i don't like that the dye comes off of the patch.,3
9119,"Have only been using for a week,but seems to be helping",3
9126,It works better along with workout.  Would be nice if it is longer to cover more of the waistline.  It is very easy to apply.,3
9129,Paid for next day air and got it four days later..... As far as the product it worked so no complaint there.,3
9131,"Timely delivery, product arrived as described,  easy to use.",3
9139,Didn't realize you can't use this while breastfeeding so I'll have to wait a bit before I try it!,3
9153,This body butter is fair enough. Not too happy with the scent though.,3
9155,Fresh fruity smell. My skin is very dry and i found the moisture it delivered was not long lasting.,3
9164,They leak just a little bit when you squeeze them. But otherwise they work like they should :),3
9173,It's a cream. Nothing notable about it and I doubt I'd purchase it again.,3
9175,Have used nectifirm in the past. This is not as good. It is just cheaper.,3
9178,"I really can't tell that this product does anything besides generally moisturize.  On the plus side, it wasn't very expensive.",3
9185,"Product feels a little sticky to the touch, and so far I haven't seen any improvements in my skin!",3
9196,"Love all the stampers and scrapers.  Not impressed with the plate it came with, could not get any polish to transfer from it.",3
9199,But with a file I can smooth them out and still wear them if I can find a big back to keep them in.,3
9210,Love the color but I didn't realize how much the shipping was until after it was sent - not worth it. You could just go to NYX.com,3
9211,exactly what I expected for the price of these. the brushes fall apart and the bristles fall out,3
9212,"some brushes are useable, some are just odd, but good variety for the price and amount of brushes you get.",3
9213,They had strong scent that stayed for a couple days...they are ok I guess,3
9225,I can't really see a difference  I've been using most days.  Not sure I can recommend.,3
9232,I've been using this for about 2 months and haven't seen much difference. Maybe my skin is too old.,3
9240,"Smells good, makes my skin soft, not correcting dark spots.",3
9250,Haven't seen any remarkable results... too soon to tell.,3
9256,Does not do that great of a job on removing the glue it was bought for and burns slightly.,3
9270,"Overall, nice glass vials. But rollers could be better.",3
9272,I wish these were more consistent in delivering the contents to you skin. It's either gushing liquid or nothing's coming out at all.,3
9280,My hair is too thin I could not get it to look right. But my husband had fun with it.,3
9281,nice hair but too thin and doesn't blend with my hair.,3
9291,"I like the product, and like the resolves and want to try it again!! It work great!!",3
9292,Not worth all the hype just made my skin feel nice,3
9293,I used the product as directed on my abdomen area. I used all three of the wraps and did not notice any change.,3
9294,"does work but not as good as another brand
lil messer too",3
9296,Its ok. It would not stay in place unless I put surround wrap which was a pain,3
9313,I'm sure it works as advertised. It didn't give me the look I was hoping for,3
9321,"This doesn't seem to work as good as PERFECT, not sure why. It did an okay job.",3
9332,The curls were not as defined as I thought. Still a good quality brush.,3
9337,My son who is 13 states that he really likes it. So therefore I would have to say it's a good product.,3
9343,"Awesome concept, smooth ""application"" and the buffing side is nice, but way too big for my hand to really grip and make flawless.",3
9360,I like the darkest contour color but none of the others. The highlighter doesn't show up and the other colors are very unnatural.,3
9375,Package came and the powders were all crushed. I did not get to try out the product for that reason.,3
9380,Really good product. Only issue I have is that they are a little orangy.,3
9381,Got this for my teenage daughter & loves them but some were cracked,3
9390,Thought the product was a cream pallette versus powder.  Inexperienced with powder.,3
9415,For the price it is ok. The colors are very true to what you see on-line.,3
9416,Most of the colors are fine except for the purple and of you later too much it can become tacky.,3
9417,"I was expecting bright red, but it turned out to be Orange instead.....and it is very sticky....although the color does stay on...",3
9419,"Not a bad product, and the color seems to stay for a bit, but it makes my lips really dry.",3
9434,"Doesn't smell as lovely as I'd hoped, but my husband likes the smell. alright, not fab.",3
9473,Smells really good but don't like the shimmer sparkles in it,3
9497,Smells good but really worth the miney? Probably not- skin feels same as it did using drugstore nivea,3
9503,"I didn't see a difference, but i like the smell.",3
9513,Smells amazing.  Not sure it does what it claims as far as skin firming.,3
9517,"Smell is a little much for me, but I definitely benefit from this stuff's reflective qualities in the summer!",3
9568,"much, much smaller than I imagined.  Works fine for carrying in my purse, but too small for blowing hair dry with a dryer.",3
9571,Took a very long time to get to me but it fits my 1 year old so great! Looks just like the picture and very comfy ,3
9584,Okay. I love the gold. I think Sally Henson is better for stamping. Good price though.,3
9592,a little too watery for good stamping but great colors.,3
9593,They are not as good as I thought. Expected better stamping polish from Bunder Monster.,3
9594,"Nice polish. Stamps clearly, Not as pigmented as I would like, but works well enough.",3
9599,Had a hard time getting up onto the stamper. Not sure why.,3
9606,I love the way they turn out only on lighter polishes.  The colors don't come off as dark as you would hope,3
9617,Its cute but really small.. I thought it would be a little bigger.,3
9623,Average shipping. Stops and starts charging while my phone is on it. Doesn't charge much due to this malfunction.,3
9625,wouldn't work with supplied usb cable. used an old cable and it works fine.,3
9631,It was OK but didn't charge as fast as I expected.,3
9637,"I had to send it back, it simply does not remove my hair.",3
9684,"Maybe it's my skin, the short timeframe but I didn't notice any difference.",3
9686,I like it but don't think I would buy again.,3
9689,I couldn't get it styled like the photo so I sent it back.,3
9707,Seems to work well. However it has a strange smell to it.,3
9710,Wish I got more for my money but it worked great after a shower before bed to hydrate my skin.,3
9719,probably need to use more often and give it a chanc,3
9720,its ok  its moisturizing but i don't think its helping with the dark circles.  I will try something else next time,3
9723,I didn't see the result and pump system is not good.,3
9725,"Good, but tended to irritate my eyes after a while. I have very sensitive skin around my eyes.",3
9729,I have been using this for over 3 months. it isn't doing much good for me. No damage either.,3
9732,"More hype than anything else. Nice sent and very creamy, but no noticeable difference in either eye puffiness or lines.",3
9737,I've been using this product twice a day.  Not sure it is working.... will give it a little more time.,3
9751,"My daughter loves this, but I find it doesn't remove my mascara sufficiently and so I wake up with raccoon eyes.",3
9767,The plastic is not as strong as expected.  They will serve their purpose anyhow.,3
9777,These nails are gorgeous but are best for a single occasion. The glue isn't good quality and they get scratched or fall off very easily.,3
9794,"not what I thought it was , not well on bleached hair",3
9831,I like the way it look.. But??.. the glue is not that great.. time will tell.,3
9836,If you are traveling and your hands are dirty good luck getting this open!,3
9845,"Loved the idea. Lavender smell could be stronger which is what I was hoping for. Great for the gym, hiking, kids and the elderly.",3
9864,Chain is sorta small.. And the head piece is a bit too wide. Good thing you can bend it a bit. But overall beautiful.,3
9878,Nice conditioner. Didn't do much for volume. Easy transaction.,3
9898,Smells really good-to me personally doesn't last very long. But a lot better than full price if you're just wanting to try out the scent.,3
9900,"hmmm not sure this did much, made my lips feel soft for a few hours, then they were actually itchy and peeling :/",3
9924,Bought it for no reason. Hardly used it so idk if it works.,3
9928,"Not much in the bottle....ran out quickly, but liked it.",3
9947,Not one hundred % satisfied because two of the tweezers had no grip.:( Kind of disappointed.,3
9986,"earrings were fomd little large .e not too thrilled with size
wrapping not very good
gift ard terriblr
I will not bu gift ard and wrapping again",3
9993,"Works well and does not make my.eyes sensitive, but is a little overpriced for the results",3
12,I like the idea. It works maybe better than nothing? I am glad I bought it.,4
50,I wasn't sure that this would make a difference and... I was wrong this actually works. Even my hubby noticed.,4
53,"So far, my wife likes this cream and plans to order more.",4
62,"Nice for a more lightweight moisturizer for the body.  Unfortunately, my face requires something a bit heavier.",4
66,"It works great, there is a little smell from it, but not bad.",4
67,"Great shipping and these bottles are pretty big, so the value is good, too.",4
68,I like this oil. Its just a tad heavy but still a nice oil.,4
79,I think this does a nice job moisturizing and adding shine to hair.,4
85,Makes my hair super soft and smooth.  I also use it as a face moisturizer and my face looks great.,4
87,"love argan oil for hair and face.  no greasy feeling, feels wonderful",4
91,I have been using this in my daughters hair and what a difference it has made. Her hair shines so much more. Thank you.,4
98,Seems the same as pure argan oil I got from another supplier - absorbs well.,4
101,"So far I have really enjoyed this product. I have noticed thicker, healthier looking hair, and skin since I have been using this product.",4
105,Used this on my unruly curls and I really saw a difference.,4
125,"You can really feel the stinging tingling sensation
Didn't see much of a difference very temporary I have a big bottom lip and thinner upper lip",4
142,"Good quality, but it does not look as good as in the picture",4
158,"Smrlls and feels winderful, but doesnt last as long as milled doaps.",4
186,"Pretty and inexpensive.  It is a clip-on earring and not very comfortable, but for the price you can't complain.",4
189,"It came as shown in the pic, but the clip on the",4
199,I was very pleased with these earrings. Very danty indeed. I am always looking for stud earrings.,4
201,Well I loved it the only problem I had was the packaging and because of that they were bent. But ok so far.,4
217,"They are cute,have patience with shipping. I do like them a lot though. Different,hard to find tiny hoops likethese.",4
222,They are really cute and the perfect size for my daughter! They also got here really fast!,4
229,Clasp is a bit difficult to attach. They look smaller than expected.,4
253,These were very cheaply made and the first time I tried to wear them one of the clasp to the earring broke.,4
269,"Earrings are very pretty.  They fasten easily and securely.  Bought a pair as a gift too and they were very much liked,",4
275,These are nice but very tiny - they are not as big as the picture,4
293,pretty and simple for any day. comfy to wear.,4
303,I like them the only thing it's that is a little bit hard to put them on but they are goid for the price.,4
305,Super cute.  Not sure how long before they tarnish but they are worth what I spent for sure.,4
309,"May be nickel plated but will stay in day to day.  Really small,  so am I but I think too small like kid size.",4
311,They are very nice.  They have a little weight to it which I don't care for. But doesn't take from the look.,4
325,I love this company but not too crazy about this one. It seems that it is not strong enough.,4
332,Love how it gives the steam. Wish the hood was made of more dense material. It was cheap looking when I got it.,4
333,This is a powerful steamer. The facial steamer feature is better than the hair steamer. I just saved some money on facials :)),4
334,"It came in good time, and it works just like it said it would, Really enjoy steaming my face.",4
336,Loved it! Did what it was suppose to do. Moisturize!,4
344,I couldn't get it to stay between my 38D boobs- otherwise great idea!,4
353,Helps to have a shirt or tank top on while sleeping.,4
356,"Good. The button before head is kind of loose, but worth the price",4
360,Bought these as gifts and they were really pleased with the diffuser.  They haven't tried the car one yet.,4
371,Very nice lotion. I will update if I get results,4
373,"Bought two, both were missing their clear caps. One was leaking in the package but still usable. Fast shipping.",4
377,"So far so good, but I am not sure it really works to lighten my age spots.",4
381,"This actually is working! My skin looks clearer, smoother, and my fine lines are diminished. No burning or peeling. Will def buy more.",4
382,Good product!! I use it under a moisturizing night cream. Appears to significantly improve the texture of my skin.,4
391,I really like the product. I did not like the way it was packaged.,4
413,Pretty cool. Fairly realistic looking. You do have to have a certain face for it - it didn't work for me.,4
421,"very nice to wear on a casual outing, will keep.",4
424,"Nice product, but is much entangled . Fast delivery.",4
428,"I like it n is very nice,it came on scheduled date",4
430,"came in earlier than stated, it's beautiful, but the necklace is actually long.",4
439,For the price is a beautiful organizer. The color is great. I will buy it again.,4
443,"Great follow up to the shampoo, conditions without leaving my fine hair limp. Smells nice too.",4
481,"Smells okay, but I was expecting it to smell more like coconut. Very perfumey.",4
483,Favorite belly bottom I've ever got! I like the way it looks. Super cute,4
489,It does the job - fills in sensitive spots.  I was surprised to see artificial favors in ingredients.  Missed that when searching.,4
491,very soft & works great! only giving it 4 stars because the way it's supposed to wrap around your head is not intuitive.,4
492,"Very absorbent. Was hoping it would be a little longer (for thick, long hair). Still works a lot better than the Turbie Twist.",4
494,I LOVED THIS! simple. Keeps hair hydrated and tamed while getting ready or applying makeup! MUST BUY FOR ALL HAIR TYPES!,4
505,Super plush. Do wish it had a stretchy strap though.,4
510,Works great - could be just a touch larger (and I have a very small head). But definitely gets the job done!,4
511,"Works great for my daughters thick curly hair, although it's a little tight fitting for her, even at 7yrs old.",4
513,I like it & won't use a regular towel on my hair any more.,4
522,Loved the microfiber but I have short hair and it is more difficult to wrap securely around my head.  Better for long hair.,4
526,Very absorbent & I think it is larger than others I looked at.,4
527,"This was a gift, but I use mine all the time",4
530,I like it. Control oil and does minimise my pores though only slightly.,4
535,"Although I have oily skin and it does not combat the oil, it works well covering large pores!",4
536,"I love the product, but I did not realize .5 is really small for the money.",4
543,This stuff really works and at a fraction of the price of other products that claim to do the same thing. Almost looks like airbrushing.,4
545,I like it . It helps minimize my pores. You just have to re-apply since it doesn't hold all day.,4
548,"Works great, wouldn't call it a miracle though and is a bit oily feeling",4
553,Great accessory. Too big for a toddler but otherwise great!,4
558,Bought these for my son for Christmas.  He LOVES them!,4
564,They reauire bobby pins to keep positioned but are super cute and comfy.,4
570,My daughter likes them as they do not have a head band.,4
580,It's hard to keep the ears in the right place but it's worth it.,4
600,"Not the biggest fan of the smell, but it gets the job done, and thats all I can really ask for.",4
617,Works great. Gently cleans. The only thing I would request is bigger bottles.,4
622,This is a great product. I definitely recommend it.,4
625,"Good color. I wish it stayed on a bit longer, but that is a small price to pay for non-toxic gloss.",4
638,"Organic, lighter than expected but very natural looking, and good for your lips.",4
646,It's really relaxing to roll my face after skincare. Helps with puffiness too. Would recommend.,4
652,Jade roller works great but the smaller roller detached on the 3rd day in my possession.,4
655,"Ordered two and one was broken. Once I glued the end back on, worked great. Box was crushed but the price was right",4
666,Very nice but not wrapped as a new item and no directions,4
668,"It looks like the picture.  For the price, it is pretty decent.",4
681,I like it and all just made my skin way to oily,4
689,"You can adjust the size on these, but if you have smaller wrists they are still going to be too big. They are pretty though.",4
705,Its soft in the hair. Doesnt look greasy or sticky.,4
713,I use this with the leave in conditioner and my hair holds its curls well.,4
716,"I have short natural hair and this product seems to do the trick making my hair curly and looking healthy
I love it",4
722,"Yes, I really like the how it moisturizers my hair, and accent my curls.",4

728,I really like this stuff it leaves my hair soft but keeps the frizz away!,4
730,Makes my curls soft and gets rid of the frizz.,4
735,It's definitely a good moisturizer.  Gave it 4 starts because for that price I expected more than just an 8 ounce,4
743,It does leave a nice smell on the hair and does provide a light hold to your natural curls after shampooing and conditioning...Thanks.,4
747,smells great just don't moisturize like i wanted it to,4
749,I really like the product and would consider getting it again sometime.,4
750,Love the way it makes my hair feel and provide a nice soft curl for my fine hair.,4

763,"Good, leaves nice curls (adds a tiny bit of crispiness)",4
766,Really like this product so far.  ...have been using for 2 weeks.,4
772,So far this is one of the only products that I have tried that actually holds my curls. Shipped quickly too.,4
775,The product moisturizes well. It works great for my six year old with extremely tight curls. I would definitely purchase it again.,4
776,Not worth the price for the size of the container but product seems to work just like every other curl cream,4
779,Since using the product my daughter's hair is manageable and her natural curls are beautiful. Thank you,4
797,Not hard or sticky as most curly hair products tend to be. Nice mellow fragrance.,4
807,Great leave in conditioner and good for daily moisture to hair.,4
810,Love this stuff!!! Keeps my curls all day... not greasy and doesn't leave a film. Highly recommended! !!!!,4
817,"Nice product for the cost, one comb came with some of the pins bent but it was easy enough to bent back.",4

847,Very pretty.  I can't wait for my wedding day!,4
850,"bought for a gift. products were nice, but the packaging wasn't attractive and the box was a bit messed up.",4
851,Good product. The ears can go a lil lopsided tho.,4
853,"They don't stay in very well since they are a bit heavy, I may add another clip to each. Super cute though",4
856,need to work on the attachment mechanism but they are cool,4
859,"Nice pins for gray hair. Glad to find them, since no one carries them in a store. Easy to use.",4
861,They are darker than I anticipated.  More gray than silver.,4
876,Seems like a good oil. It smells good and doesn't leave a film on the bottom of my feet.,4
880,So far its good. First night didn't completely work but pain was less severe. The others nights have been great.,4
890,"So far, I am pleased with the results of using this product",4
896,I have only used it a few times so far. Not sure I see results but will report back later.,4
899,I've noticed some improvement with my chronic insomnia and my husband says it's helped a little with his back pain.,4
902,Use it for aching muscles and to help fall asleep.  It seems to help both.,4
913,I like it but  I only give it four stars because it leaves the tacky feeling.,4
914,"The product is excellent, but the price is high.",4
917,Still makes my skin a little itchy but works so well for RLS during pregnancy.,4
935,"I like it so far, I've only been using it for three days...but definitely will continue it.",4

996,"So far, this product is meeting my expectation. I do feel my pain lessens when I spray directly on the area.",4

1010,I like the product but the bottle be more slender to make it easier to handle.,4
1013,It has really helped with my leg cramps and pain at night.,4

1680,Serves its purpose. Wish it wasn't so short in the back,4
1690,"Very good for haircuts, not waterproof but very comfortable, light and airy. The snaps are great.",4
1694,Worked good but the smallest button would not latch. I bought to use on my toddler so I had to use a pin instead.,4
1696,cape is what it is shown to be. Its bigger than I thought but thats ok,4
1697,Works well and is large enough for a person sitting in a wheel chair.,4
1698,Worked well but have to wonder how long the plastic snaps will last.,4
1701,"I was a little surprised at how lightweight it is, but it does the job.",4
1713,It closes on my neck and keeps the hairs from falling into itchy places. Plenty of size adjustability too. Does the trick.,4
1719,"This works very well for me.  Lightweight but durable.  It's not waterproof, but I'm only using it as a shield for trimming hair.",4
1721,The cape is fine. I just hate how the hair static clings to it and so I don't feel like it is clean to put away.,4
1725,"Its a thin Cape, perfect for Haircuts, love the snaps verses velcro.  Great price",4
1732,the snaps are a bit difficult to click but the cape works well and its better than having hair all over you,4
1740,"Nice quality, fits small to xlarge neck sizes, the back could've been a little longer but otherwise as expected. I would recommend this cape",4
1746,Quality is good. Don't like that it is short in the back and it has buttons on the neck.,4
1747,"Serves it's purpose ok, and it was super cheap, but you get what you pay for...",4
1754,"Works great. Made me want to wear it, and only it, while dancing with no shoes on.",4
1756,"this cape is light weight, snaps are good and the size is excellent.  It does it's job and does it well.",4

1780,I really love the headbands they were just a little thin.,4
1804,"it does the job, but rolls/ flakes on the skin",4
1824,I like it but will have to it for a longer time to give an accurate review.,4

1861,My daughter enjoys wearing it. Not the highest quality but great for making an outfit fun,4
1866,the clasp broke but it still works and i have had it for 2 monthss,4
1867,I like this product a lot but I was disappointed when it didn't come with clasps to adjust. I mean it fits.,4
1871,"Really cute and cheap, shipping takes a little while and you can't track it so that sucks but still is a good choker.",4
1872,I would love it but it broke a little around the back. Luckily my mom fixed it before it got too bad. Still cute though,4

2072,Doesn't capture the light or sparkle. Looks fake.,4
2083,Could not find my color until I came upon it here. Very happy with my purchase!,4
2085,My wife really likes the protection this offers to her phone,4
2098,"great product, creates nice looking lashes that look natural not fake.",4

2119,The veil was beautiful and the price was right. Devale tends to be extra long so we had to cut it.,4

2149,"Good product. It's a little small for my liking, but does the job well and great value for the price! Will certainly purchase again.",4
2151,Glides on nicely but has a tendency to smudge when the weather is warm. I'm wondering if it needs setting powder?,4
2153,Works well. Doesn't smudge. Can get a little dry.,4
2154,Worth the money. Harder to use than Bobbi Brown.,4

2474,Love this eye cream.  Seems to have reduced dark circles and puffiness very well.,4
2478,This works very well but doesn't seem to have an effect on my dark circles.  It's effective for reducing puffiness,4
2482,The cream is very light and does not irritate my eyes at all and a little goes a long way,4
2505,Easy to use.  I felt a warming sensation.  It must have been burning fat. Will try again.,4
2507,it is effective . but along with it I am exercising and eating clean,4

2515,"It works very well specially after taking shower makes your body too hot, you feel getting fire!",4

2721,Used for two months and it seems to be helping my years of sun damaged skin. I'll be ordering another bottle soon...,4
2724,I tried vitamin C serum at the same time so I don't know what product is doing what. I like that it is gluten free.,4

3180,"Love it, it actually works. I'll be ordering more.'",4
3181,Fits pretty well. My only complaint would be that the velcro sometimes doesn't hold up during the night.,4
3182,"Overall, this is a nice product.  It has a soft scent and smooth texture, perfect for making lotions to add your own scents too.",4
3188,My only complaint is the size of the thumb hole. Even my wife who has long slender fingers said they hurt her thumb while using them.,4

3216,"The little blue plastic rings fall right out of the handles. Otherwise, this product is exactly as advertised.",4
3230,Just too thick to use under my ear.  I guess I can cut it across.  Then I'd have two!,4
3233,Its exactly what I was looking for. I just wish it came with some kind of cover.,4
3238,"It works. Unsurprisingly, it is not as comfortable as a pillow but wrapping with an old cut up pillow case is easy enough.",4
3250,Only reason it didn't get 5-stars is because the container is very hard to open,4
3260,"They came packaged well, but one of them didn't match.",4
3262,They are fragile as far as when you remove the wig the top circle comes off but not a major factor. Great price and great functionality.,4

3270,"thought it would be a little more sturdy, but I love it none the less. Makes my Truck distinct now",4
3277,"Love this thing for the shower, so much so that bought another one.  Does seem easy to scratch, though.  Shaving cream smells great.",4

3366,So far seems to be working it actually is making my lashes seem fuller more to come with this review.,4

3393,Great little tool for removing contact len's.  Bought several for use when traveling or just about town.,4

4086,I thought they were gonna last longer but for the price its fine. I did not like the fact they were different sizes.,4
4087,I was pleasantly surprised at how pigmented these lip liners were.  I would recommend them to a friend.,4
4092,Don't stay on as long as you would expect :/ still super nice for the price !,4
4093,The colors are nice. I am new to this lip thing so i've only used the plum and cola...,4
4104,For my lips I have to shade in a bit hard but the color last longer than my other liners and lipstick.,4
4106,Nicely pigmented for the price. Great product! I'm happy with it :),4
4127,I expected a wider array of colors. Theres a lot of brown shades and not enough pinks and purples,4
4129,These are good liners.  My only complaint is the smell - it's overpowering and smells like a concentrated berry exploded in your face!,4
4133,Love the liner. Thr colors are so vibrant and creamy like nyx lip liners.,4
4137,"LOVE the colors, they are gorgeous! If you eat/drink with these on you will have to reapply.",4

4166,"a couple came broken, those intact are very pretty and apply easily, not drying.",4
4182,"it works better than peroxide in my skin, less aggressive and similar results.",4
4186,It works but smells awful and the scent is too strong to cover up,4
4189,Like the product because it calms the redness on the pimple. Thank you,4
4190,This product does a really good job of drying up trouble spots.,4
4193,This product helped dry out blemishes and even offered a little coverage. Beware though because unless you are fair skinned it may show a bit.,4
4202,"Love the smell but wish there was more powder in the bottle for the price it is. A bit expensive, but Love the smell!",4
4221,Scent is light but need to apply twice a day to control normal day body odor.,4
4222,"Works well for 24hrs. but hard to use.  Wooden stick makes it easier, but still messy.",4
4240,Super product. Has great feel & is produced with unmatched quality in mind.,4
4252,Does not eliminate order completely but is very good for my skin and is a great all-natural deodorant.,4
4279,Got this recently as I was looking for a nontoxic deodorant. This is EWG recommended and I can thankfully say it works great and smells great.,4
4288,"Nice, vibrant colors, but they don't last long.",4
4293,I love these.  I'm very happy that you get six in the package so you can choose different colors different days.,4
4300,"The tattoos are all very beautiful and versatile. My one issue is that, at least on me, they wore off in only three days.",4
4316,This does everything it saids.  I am an older person and definitely will order again.,4
4321,It's an excellent product but it's nothing like permanent. It fades out when you eat oily food.,4
4322,Wear great for up to 4 hours then starts to breakdown and get crumbly as it wears off. BEAUTIFUL COLOR OPTIONS THO!,4
4325,"I Like it!  Will be a better shade worn over a darker lip pencil, was lighter than I thought it would be.",4
4326,The colour is beautiful but very matte.  It is very drying. You will need to moisturize your lips beforehand and while wearing it.,4
4332,The color is beautiful. The only problem I have is that the product spills out of the tube when I close it.,4
4335,"Works great, but does pill and feather when eating.

I don't care for the overly matte finish. It makes lips appear flaky",4
4337,Be warned this is very matte. I would suggest prepping and moisturising lips before application. Dries down to a great natural looking colour.,4
4346,Wish the brushes were labeled to help someone who doesnt know what the brushes are for  otherwise its a quality product nice and soft brushes,4
4351,They are true to the picture only thing I did not like was the sponge it was cheap quality but everything else was good :),4
4352,My lady brought this for me to carry my clippers in with style..she the best..,4
4357,"Best out there, comes quick my cousin and I use it all the time and mine even lasts a week with one coat.",4
4362,Very happy with the purchase for this price. I am sure there are much more high quality brushes out there but on a budget this works.,4
4382,I really like this product.  Feels very nice.  Not sticky at all.  Is there another scent?  Does anyone know?,4
4383,This was a gift for my mother. She says she 'loves it'!,4
4400,I have very sensitive eyes.  This product did make me itch a little but much less than other products.,4
4406,"I love this eyeliner! But,, a overpriced for such a little tube.",4
4408,Gluten free and glides on like a charm. 4 stars simply because of the amount for 20$ and the applicator could be less sponge.,4
4428,"The roller ball was hard to get started but once it got started, it works great.",4
4449,Great price. Like the shapes. Will last a long time. A little goes a long way,4
4452,Nice product.  Give it a try.  I mixed the light and dark together to get the shade I needed.,4
4458,Didn't realize the color would be so dark. Otherwise I am very happy,4
4479,It's a good product but for me I think I need something a  little  lighter not colour but texture it looks to heavy on me not natural,4
4484,Love Revlon products! Been using them for years. Best drugstore makeup brand for me!,4
4491,Initially it was extremely runny. After shaking it up a few times it came out much better. Nice color and coverage.,4
4530,They sent me a replacement since than no problems. I like it.,4
4537,Very pretty.  Soft thick . I already picked out my favorite brushes. More for powder foundation though.,4
4541,"Nice material, the box is really nice as well.",4
4544,These are not flushable but that's my fault for not checking before ordering,4
4547,The chain was a little flimsy but was beautiful overall. The exact look I wanted.,4
4553,This is so much fun to wear and my lips feel refreshed and happy.,4
4566,"Nice, my husband loves the poppie seeds but doesnt like how it gets all over the shower, what are you going to do? Good quality soap",4
4574,I love the smell and lather of this soap. Wish the price was lower though.,4
4586,Ok...but not much fragrance...cleans well.....rinsed clean...would have liked more fragrance.,4
4591,It works how its supposed to and it smells good too,4
4629,My husband uses this soap and is very satisfied with it.,4
4630,"Not your typical heavy pachouli scent, but a powdery version. Subtle, but very nice.",4
4642,"I love this soap, but it almost has a slight citronella smell to it that I'm not very keen on.",4
4648,The soap itself is amazing - its neutral and fresh. But the size of a the bar is very small. See pics,4
4652,"Love the soap, this isn't my favorite fragrance, but it is true to its name..raspberry.",4
4657,Smells very good but kind of dry out my skin. Maybe not for dry skin people.,4
4663,This soap has a great smell and a great leather but a bit expensive cost,4
4667,"A little pricy for the quality.
I use it but don't know if I would buy again.",4
4672,works great. but cant use it everyday / have to use a bath sponge,4
4683,Great soap but the scent isn't really my type :(,4
4688,Smells lovely.  Great Value.  A few little scratchy bits in the soap but that's probably the same for most herbal soaps.,4
4706,Pleasant but not very fragrant. the soap itself is nice and creamy,4
4711,Smells amazing. Scrubs the skin nicely but leaves a soapy film on my body,4
4714,"Loved this soap. Smells great and left my skin feeling clean, soft, and hydrated.",4
4715,nice exfoliator soap but I didn't like the scent very well,4
4717,"Very moisturizing, long lasting bar.
I'd like to try another scent.",4
4725,"A very large piece of soap, use it to wash hands. It doesn't really have much smell, the way I like it.",4
4738,"Nice, long-lasting soap without an overpowering scent. Good quality.",4
4751,"I like this soap, but jasmine smelled a lot better to me.",4
4752,"I like this soap, but jasmine smelled a lot better to me.",4
4758,Very strong scent so make sure you like gardenia.  Would make a good guest bathroom soap.,4
4763,This is high quality hard milled French soap that produces a rich and fragrant lather and leaves a subtle floral fragrance behind.  A pleasure to use.,4
4764,"Smells lovely and delicate, though not as strongly as I expected. Pretty color and bigger than imagined. Will definitely repurchase -- maybe in another scent.",4
4766,The rose petal scent is sweet but not overpowering. The soap generates a moderate lather. It left no sticky nor filmy residue. Very nice!,4
4768,"Good soap, smells pleasant, suds great, and rinses off quickly.",4
4772,"This has a very subtle lavender smell.  It's a very large soap,  and lasts a long time.",4
4790,Lathers nicely. Lasts for a long time. My skin doesn't dry out as much.,4
4803,Real mild soap! No too fragrant just right! Would buy again!,4
4805,My wife like this soap... I am not a bit fun. But I will keep buying it for her....,4
4816,"lasts a long time, smells great. LOVE the product. It does leave residue in the bath though.",4
4821,Moisturizing if you like bar soap and doesn't dry skin too much!,4
4826,Made my skin feel soft. The only negatives it's rather large but shrinks quickly with when used.,4
4828,Not much scent but great lather.  Lasts a long time.,4
4901,"Akin to the scent of an aveda product, but much cheaper. Left my hands feeling nice and soft, too.",4
4948,This soap lessens the dryness of my skin. I'm going to buy it again.,4
4955,Nice soap. It smells wonderful and makes my skin moisturized. The bar melts fast tho.,4
4957,I didn't expect this soap to be big. It smells great and is moisturizing for my dry skin. The only problem is it melts easily.,4
4962,"Lathers well, doesn't melt, cleans but doesn't strip, subtle fragrance. High priced.",4
4972,"This soap is very nice! Leaves the skin soft, clean and has a subtle scent to it.",4
4983,I'd buy this monthly if it wasn't so pricy. :/,4
4985,I like this soap. It smells fresh and is quite moisturizing.,4
5014,Wow it definitely smells like Jasmine but the smell does not linger at all. The rose on the other hand is a different story!,4
5020,"This is such a good product, Great on skin and very nice sense",4
5032,Love the soap!  Smell is wonderful. Bar lasts a long time.,4
5045,Smells wonderful and the bits of lavender in the soap feels like an exfoliation is going on. I like it though.,4

5088,"Sharp corners and big, I recommend cutting it in half..........",4
5128,This was a gift and recipient said she liked it.,4
5133,"The soap was great quality, I wasn't crazy about the fragrance.  Was told that it had earthy fragrance.",4
5163,Nice soap.  Great scent.  Buds are kinda rough and scratchy.,4
5164,Nice large size bar - very hard to find these days.  Soaps up nicely and has a nice mild fragrance.,4
5173,smells nice but if you don't like all the petals in the soap this is not the soap for you,4
5176,"Love the Pre de Provence soaps, favorites are Lavender and Peony, I like this but not a true gardenia scent.",4
5189,"Very nice soap, does not leave a residue on the skin and smells like actual roses, not a chemical.  I love using it everyday.",4

5254,I like the Rose petal but my first choice is the lavender. Any of the soaps you get from here are great though.,4
5287,"It smells horrible, as usual, but it is okay in terms of cleaning and not over-drying. It lasts a pretty long time",4
5288,This has a really good smell. But it is way too expensive for what it is. Trying to find something similar but less expensive.,4
5295,"I like this soap and the almonds serve as a scrub. I will purchase this soap again.
thats all I have",4
5296,"has pretty good scrubbie to it, could have more.  The pine smell is perfect, not to strong but strong enough.",4
5302,I buy a lot of lavender products and some don't smell like the real thing. This does smell like true lavender.,4
5304,I bought 1 bar of Pre de Provence Soap Sage & plan on buying more.  I think it's great on rough skin.,4

5307,"If you like fancy bars of soap, you will like this! This was a gift for my sister and she loves French milled soaps.",4

5327,"Our family liked this one, although 4 year old laughs when wash the bottom of his feet as it tickles ;-)...",4
5331,The oil doesn't make your hair any blonder but the shampoo and conditioner did a bit.,4
5337,Good combination. I love the oil that is part of the kit!,4

5376,Good product. The burning I felt initially is gone but it is a bit aggravating in the beginning.  Great price.,4
5377,So far this product is helping ease my knee pain.,4
5382,It relieves discomfort in my feet and the pain in my lower leg after massaging it in at night.,4

5425,Definitely have to brush it a bit buts it's not matted like other wigs I've bought,4
5433,This wig is going to be SO fun....I love the length and it's very pretty in person. It's pretty thick considering the price.,4

5440,Bought this as a gift for the daughter-n-law.  She liked it.  I was unimpressed with the packaging.  It was in a cheap cellophane sleeve.,4
5453,I love this packageing for an eyeliner but it did come off a little but not a lot. I still love it and use it everyday,4
5455,Surprised how well this goes on and stays on for the price,4
5471,This lotion is wonderful for anyone who has chronic or general muscle/joint pain.  I use it daily and my sleep has improved.,4
5474,"It's heavily alcohol based, which makes it evaporate quickly but is a poor moisturizer.",4

5480,"Exactly as described,  got it earlier than expected. Thank you very much!",4
5481,I ordered the wrong size case but it was very pretty and I sold it locally very fast.,4
5487,Nice.  Brissels are softer than I expected and I had to purchase a nylon rope to hand it in my shower.,4
5498,Minus 1 star cause the magnets don't line up well. But it does fit in a lot of stuff,4
5499,It's OK and it holds a lot. Just it doesn't fold Like in the picture,4

5575,"item as described, just didn't solve my foot problem as I had hoped.
timely delivery, positive transaction",4
5576,Great product.  The only thing that I don't like is that the straps began to fray after a couple months.  Other than that it is perfect,4
5583,"I was limping badly before wearing this, and while it has not yet cured the problem I'm walking without noticeable problems.",4
5592,Really helped take the pain from my plantar fasciitis.  Only problem I have with it is that the elastic causes my feet to sweat  and irritated.,4
5595,price is good. construction is not perfect but it is holding together and comfortable to wear.,4
5603,Those worked great.  It did burn my eyes if I got to close. BUT I saw growth!,4
5608,great brush used it to even out my make up and it was great and I got to try it for a low price for a review,4
5610,"Somewhat difficult application but with a couple of failed attempts due to very thin and delicate film, I was able to master it with forceps.",4
5613,"My wife got married wearing this, and she loves it. But one side broke on it (still stayed on).",4
5623,"Uhm, the lip balms are tiny!!! But they are so cute. They have a sweet smell and are far from waxy.",4
5649,"Made my face very red afterwards and dry, I will try it a few more times to view more differences. Shipping and seller handling were great.",4
5652,Came at the beginning of the arrival date. The travel size pack is a great way to test several of the products. So far very satisfied!,4
5664,Was smaller than I expected but very nice necklace! Received plenty of compliments,4
5672,It is an adorable piece. It is much larger than I expected but a very pretty costume piece. Very lightweight also.,4
5677,"HUGE was looking for something a bit more subtle but that is on me the piece is flawless, great piece",4
5682,Nice bling. L-o-l. It looks just as pretty in person. It's not heavy btw.,4
5692,very pleased with this item. size and discription is accurate. can't wait to wear.,4
5694,Received necklace faster than the expected date and it was gorgeous! It's made of plastic but still worth it!,4
5699,Great necklace from a material that doesn't break out my skin.,4
5710,I have wavy/curly hair and this product is a nice leave-in conditioner. I have noticed amazing benefits but it does a nice enough job!,4
5732,"I have thick, colored, slightly damaged hair. This does a pretty good job of detangling, softening hair. I have already repurchased it twice.",4
5744,The price definitely makes me ssad. But this is the only leave in conditioner I've found that doesn't leave my hair greasy.,4
5769,"Use as detangler...smells good, not too oily even before sleep on",4
5784,Makes your face feel like velvet but does not keep your make up on as long as others. Its o.k as a wrinkle filler,4
5785,"This is one of the best I tried, but still become oily about 5-6 hours after application.",4
5799,very good glue. sticks well. although it kinda just remains sticky. never bothers me though.,4
5803,"It's alright, weird nozzle though, you have to cut it open with scissors!",4
5807,"Huge tube but its hardly full. It's deceiving like lays potato chips, mostly air in the package. But it does the job!",4
5824,An effective product which works as advertised. The foam version seemed to be more effective but that may be a personal bias.,4
5836,"They are a gift for my grandson, he is just starting to collect these, I hope he likes them",4
5842,Quick delivery. Excellent quality. A little over priced.,4
5849,2 of the wheels had 3 wonky nails on them...not a huge deal for the good price. Good wheels for swatching colors.,4
5850,"Luv them, they are great for finding the right polish for the day or just playing.",4
5861,Pretty good quality. I recommend these better than the oval nails. They are more realistic and easier to paint on.,4
5862,"although slow to deliver, I think the quality for what was purchased was overall very good.  I would purchase from them again.  Thank you.",4
5864,There nice if you wanna practice and if you don't mind a smell of strong plastic but its a good deal as well,4
5870,"i haven't tried it yet but from the looks of it and what ive heard, its great",4
5919,"Tiny bottle. Helped, but eventually just let them close.",4
5922,Worked great and fast on healing my nose piercing!!!,4
5955,Plastic but seems to be well made. Haven't put it on my car yet. Will update once its on for a while,4
5987,"I like the ""poof"" it gives but don't use too much or you will have a messy looking head of hair.",4
5994,Really gives nice body to limp hair; good pricing; package arrived earlier than expected.,4
5996,Great for adding texture to your hair. I love it!,4
6011,I absolutely love the look of this hair accessory. My only issue is that the clasp is so hard to open and close.,4
6016,"I love this clip, easy to use and really cute!",4
6023,Cute choker and it looks just like the picture. Very good price for it too,4
6024,It is very cute. It broke right out of the package but i fixed it.,4
6027,"Pretty from a distance, but cheaply made. But you really cant expect more considering the price.",4
6031,I thought it was a Laredo type and is a chain with the feature hanging. Still cute but can't adjust like I thought I could.,4
6034,Cute & simple! Shipping did not take too long either,4
6035,"Pretty good quality, and I love how it fits!!",4
6036,"Not as tight as shown, hangs much lower. But still cute.",4
6042,This necklace is cute and looks very much like it is photographed. It shipped quickly and in good condition.,4
6047,I didn't care for this much but my teenager LOVES it!,4
6048,"For $1, this gets more compliments than anything I've ever bought so cheaply!",4
6057,Luv this product. Also the only product legal to dye brows in Oregon.,4
6059,"Great product, very easy to use.
Economical. Will purchase again.",4
6066,works good as a beard oil and hair. does not leave a greasy feeling etc. moisturizes the hair/beard etc.,4
6070,once of the best products I have used for my fine yet brittle hair very pleased with this item,4
6073,Love this product for my natural hair.  It's light and healthy.,4
6080,"I have a krimpy-curly hair texture, and this product makes my hair very smooth, soft, and shiny after flat ironing.",4
6088,good stuff and handy dispenser - a bit expensive for what you get,4
6097,This helps my hair to not get dry everytime I iron or styling my hair.,4
6107,"Nice for sheen and feeding dry ends; however, if your hair is soft, it  must be washed out before styling.",4
6113,My hands didn't stay oil after Put this on the hair.,4
6117,Kinda smelled old or expired? But it was still good and did what it was meant for.,4
6128,Works great when you're on the go. The container is larger than it looks in the picture and will probably last me a while.,4
6138,"Love this lip color, it goes on like a creamy matte",4
6153,Nice color just disappointed not really a part of the Dia de los Muertos collection came with a plain silver cap,4
6156,Love the color stays all day and not to drying on the lips one big problem was my cap didn't have the skulls,4
6163,"I didn't get belle, I got Hestia. But this color is still really really beautiful so I'm happy.",4
6197,"The clippers themselves are great. Unfortunately, the keychain part has snapped off a couple times but it's fixable.",4
6198,Clippers are great key chain attachment not the greatest. Customer service is the best I have experienced on Amazon.,4
6209,It's cute....ok for what u pay for it.....,4
6215,It is cute but I will never wear it it's a bit too large,4
6224,"For the price they are good.  Not the best quality oils.  No issues with seller, got everything in good time.",4
6228,"look authentic, though one design looked tacky.  Lost lasting even in beach and pool water for 7 days.",4
6233,"Beautiful tattoos, lasted a while when I put them on my outer forearm. Not too hard to get off, I would purchase these again.",4
6234,The tattoos are beautiful but did not come with application instructions.,4
6240,"Works great, easy to use, soft head which cleans gently, but efficiently. East to clean.",4
6243,Works well for safety but you can only get a a small size sip of fluid.,4
6244,This is very helpful as it controls the amount of fluid that can go in mouth with each sip.,4
6254,Results are not the same as Latise`.  Seems to make existing lashes thicker after 4 weeks of use.,4
6255,"At first I was skeptical , after a few weeks to 5 weeks , I saw a difference!! I love it!!",4
6258,It really does work just give it a few weeks.,4
6260,I was surprised when I saw this for so cheap! It works great. My eyelashes are definitely longer and thicker.,4
6268,"Amazing product, good color. Only drawback is doesn't last all day.",4
6277,Great product! Very happy with my purchase and will purchase more! However the power flakes off of brush very easy.,4
6279,Got the results I desired for half the price of similar brand name products.,4
6306,I very much like Boots products. Makes your skin feel so soft and evens out texture,4
6310,These work better than most but still doesn't do everything they claim.,4
6317,"Truly, first time buyer of this product. Love it.",4
6320,"So far, like this product.  Must use more religiously to determine effectiveness.",4
6324,"my wife likes this stuff, she says it works. i think it is overpriced but if it works for her it works for me.",4
6326,Very good line of products. Have been uding them for a while.,4
6330,"Seems to be pretty good product, don't like that the serum runs out so quickly. Otherwise, good product",4
6335,"Serum is wonderful, the night and face cream aren't as moisturizing as I hoped.",4
6348,"Great product, tried others this is the one that meets my expectations.",4
6354,My skin feels better but didn't see the wrinkle diminish that I expected.  Price was good and no bad effects,4
6359,"Love this product, especially the serum.  Feels so nice on and works.",4
6375,"I love the feel of this product, the smell is great too.",4
6377,"I have switched from Regenerist to this product and so far, I've liked it.",4
6386,"Haven't seen a reduction in wrinkles,  but my husband says my skin glows.",4
6407,Yes met my expectations. Very pretty to dress up and or dress down to wear with jeans.,4
6414,"Very cute! a little top heavy, but with the price, you can't beat it!",4
6423,Good quality and lots of hair for such a cheap price. They're synthetic so they do shed and get staticy but overall worth it.,4
6430,"Hi,
The lipsticks are good but I recommend having lips hydrated for better results.",4
6431,Great deal! I love all colors... All of them are very opaque and long lasting.,4
6439,Loved these...and delivery was fast and ahead of time. ..a lot  of colors..just wish it included a brown,4
6448,I bought this for my wife and she is in love of the product.,4
6472,This has a nice texture and it's pretty thick.  It sticks well to the wall and it's easy to clean.,4
6474,Lost over 100 pounds and need some cushion in the tub.  Drys quickly; very comfortable.,4
6477,"very comfy, i wish the suction cups were a little stronger",4
6478,The pillow is a little hard but Im guessing with time it will relax a little.,4
6481,Super comfy! It dries fast so it doesn't smell musty and the suction cups don't slip.,4
6486,"This pillow does exactly what it is meant to do. Give your head a softer resting place when soaking in your tub.
Works just fine!",4
6501,Like the product for most part. I ordered two and the second one was a bit dirty. Weird.,4
6510,Mud and oil duo! Kinda cool! And works well!,4
6515,"I think sometimes the brush comes out too blunt. I am still trying to master it, was so cheap its worth it!",4
6536,"Love them- slightly bigger than expected and one separated from the earring backing when I pulled it too hard, but still good.",4
6541,Its super adorable i love it the quality isn't perfect but how can you complain for the price.was also a bit smaller then i though,4
6544,"it's hard to open on first time. I have to use both my hand and my teeth.
But the lipstick its good to use.",4
6553,very sheer and more pink than red but for 82 cents you can't complain.,4
6556,Good color. But I don't really like the smell,4
6565,My husband said this was too long. Otherwise works well.,4
6574,"It's early yet, but it gets to places on my back that I can no longer reach.",4
6576,"I purchased this for my husband, he said he likes it thank you!  He said it works just fine  :)",4
6584,"Great results. Quick trick, round your back, and it makes it run smoother over your back.",4
6603,Happier with this than with any brush I've ever owned....does a good job washing my back!,4
6608,It's a decent back scrubber so far. Just got it so will update IF it changes.,4
6613,"Just what I wanted,loofah pad is a nice size , rope handles work well  Price was very good. Thanks",4
6618,"Quick shipping, wish the actual loofah area was bigger.",4
6622,I have had it less than a week.  So far I am satisfied with it.  I hope it will last a year or two.,4
6634,I bought this product for my teenage son....he loves it!  Product delivered on time!!! :),4
6636,"Neat packaging and it fluffed back up nicely after the first use. As a tall person thing comes in handy for washing feet, also. :)",4
6645,I like it fine but I wish the loofah part was larger and thicker.  Other than that everything it fine. jerry,4
6654,Perfect for washing my back. The handles are a real plus and the material looks to be quality material.,4
6655,"I have just started using this and, so far so good. The length is good for me and the loofah seems to be a good size.",4
6658,So far so good. The product is very easy to use and make getting the harder to reach areas possible!!! Really happy with it.,4
6663,Great shower with the loofah.  Arthritis keeps my range of motion limited.  With the nice long loofa scrubber I can reach every where and feels terrific!,4
6687,"I like this YlangYlang just fine, wish it was a little stronger though, but I would buy it again I'm sure!",4
6690,Love this oil. Use it in my defuser.  I mix it sometimes with frankincense oil and rose oil. Lovely. These are good oils!,4
6692,Not a fan of the smell it it does help ease migraines a little bit,4
6697,Jury is still out if it cures nail fungus.  So far I think it might be working.,4
6703,Arrived on time and securely packed. It smells great. Look forward to using in my homemade hair and body products.,4
6706,"Fragrant, nice bottle and dropper. Would order again. Fast shipping!",4
6725,not a bad product.  super inexpensive and many came with the purchase.  would buy again.,4
6726,These bracelets did help with repelling bugs. I just really do not like the citronella smell.,4
6727,We have only once so far but they seemed to work well,4
6731,My kids love these things. No bug bites so far,4
6739,Packing was good. Use to protect from mosquito bites when your kids plan to play outdoor and while doing gardening work in late evening.,4
6745,Works well so far. Use them with my kids to wear in our yard.,4
6746,"Arrived on time. Mosquito season isn't here yet, but I expect them work well",4
6755,These are great. They do work but for not as long as the seller's claim.,4
6759,works as intended but put on before you get bitten.  I tend to forget that part,4
6776,They seem to work for the kids.  That's good enough for me.,4
6778,"Stank out the car - and determined mozzies did break through, but way fewer bites than expected.",4
6791,"One is not strong enough to work successfully, but wearing one on each wrist and ankle works great!",4
6793,"Seemed to work really well on our camping trip to Twin Lakes, Mammoth. Just a few bites which is a great win - mosquitoes love me.",4
6798,These are convenient and help repel the mosquitoes.  Used them at an outdoor dinner party and did not have any problems with bites.,4
6800,These bracelets arrived on time.  I believe they did help repel mosquitos and didn't cause a reaction to skin exposed area or our wrists.,4
6802,Colorful and seem to work. Safe for kids over 3 and the like to wear them. Beats pesticide.,4
6810,Great item just as described! Could last a little longer!,4
6819,Works great especially for those who don't like the spray.  Just need to remember to return it the pouch when not in use.,4
6829,Works well with mosquitoes! Only mosquitoes! Smells great!,4
6842,"It seems slightly more fluid than other liquid latex products I've used, but certainly does its purpose.",4
6858,"Takes a bit to dry, but when it does it looks pretty cool!!",4
6865,It was very easy to work with but the texture for me was a bit runny I would prefer if it was a bit more thicker...,4
6866,"This latex does work well, but I had a hard time getting the right color I needed on it",4
6867,got for daughters Halloween costume so we will try it out when we do her makeup,4
6882,"Good for the price,  but if you want the professional quality I recommend Ben Nye. This product worked fine for what I needed though.",4
6888,"Purchased as a gift for an amateur FX artist, he like it a lot.",4
6889,This product was fun and worked great but my daughter had an allergic reaction to it so we ended up returning it.,4
6894,Haven't used it yet looks like a lot like contact cement,4
6900,"I should have checked, but it smells like ammonia.",4
6905,Worked great for the theater final.  A little more liquidy than the other liquid latex products I've used but still did a great job.,4
6913,"Great product. Works wonderfully. We used it to make open wounds, it dries quickly, worked really well.",4
6915,Works great! I put the left over latex in a mason jar so it doesn't leak.,4
6929,"Awesome, cap needs to be on tight though to prevent leakage",4
6934,It is latex so can it be irritating - nature of the beast. Strong odor. But good for beginners.,4
6935,"If you spill this on your carpet, you're gonna have a bad time!

Functioned as it said it would otherwise",4
6941,Works well but does have a pretty strong smell when wet. Thank you.,4
6942,Is there a way to further the cure?...mild Heat?,4
6950,"Works well for its purpose, easy to blend makeup into after it dries. My only issue was how long it took to dry.",4
6955,Perfect for protecting the skin around my nails when I do nail art but the fishy smell is really off-putting.,4
6957,It smells bad and should be used in a well ventilated area. It works well though.,4
6960,Pretty good I guess but not very good for layering with tissue or toilet paper.,4
6962,Great for Halloween and theatre effects. Does have an ammonia odor that goes away when it dries but that's expected.,4
6969,Its the only latex ive used i buy it because its reasonable and gets the job done,4
6977,A lot of product and worth the price I purchased for 12 the only this it has a weird smell but all latex does .,4
6982,"I am thinking about buying this for next Halloween, Does it stain clothes?",4
6984,"In no way a professional, so this is great for me.",4
6989,"I think this product is great. The only problem with it is, it's hard to take off.",4
6995,"They were a little bit hard to ""undo"" in order to pump them. But, seem like they are decent quality.",4
7008,This is a very nice pump. Good quality and fits my 33.8 oz shampoo bottle well.,4
7013,Was hard to get started at first but has worked every time.  Arrived in a timely matter.  Would recommend.,4
7025,Really cute when you they are on your ear. You can adjust them also which is good.,4
7029,Very cute. They fit nicely and were not too heavy. I wish they were real gold so that it wouldn't rust later on.,4
7030,These are cute... I got then for a gift & she loved them...,4
7043,They are beautiful and fit well but are not expensive. Will definitely buy from them again.,4
7044,Cute earrings.  I will be wearing them as very casual jewerly,4
7045,"Like the earrings very much,just a little difficult to put on since there are 3 pieces to them,but still like them",4
7046,The bottom part is the wrong length for my ears.,4
7048,"These are cute.  They don't look any different than shown and are good for every day type wear, not for special.",4
7054,"They did not come with any backs, which is annoying. The jackets are a little difficult to get right, but that is to be expected.",4
7064,"Love the product, except I got some duplicates and not all colors pictured.",4
7066,what you see in the picture is what you get. cheap price...cheap product,4
7077,Good quality product and works well to relieve pain. The concept is nice and the cups are of decent quality,4
7079,It was just like  I thought it would . Arrived sooner than expected. Very happy,4
7081,Quck delivery and at a good price.  Still waiting (only been a week) for the results.,4
7096,Haven't even tried it but I bet it's pretty okie dokie,4
7112,"Really good, but was kind of hard to fit into my tube holder.",4
7127,Fits well for my Tragus piercing. The backs are hard to get on and just fall off so I don't use the backs.,4
7130,"Arrived very quickly, seem perfect for what I'll need them for.",4
7132,"A little longer than intended, but over all no serious complaints.",4
7148,This works great for the price. My nails have never looked so great.,4
7151,Have not used this product long enough to effectively rate it.,4
7158,It's not what I expected doesn't do anything for fungus.,4
7161,"Nice polish, pretty color! Love that is doesn't have nail polish odor. Like so many other brands!!",4
7164,"seems to be working well, makes a great base coat",4
7168,"I can't really tell if this stuff is working, but then again my toenails grow very slowly. will update as I see progress.",4
7175,Took a while to arrive. They look adorable though.,4
7176,Really cute but so hard to put on. They are tiny and when get wet they are slippery.,4
7182,"My only complaint is when you first put it on it has a tacky feel. However it goes on easy, dries super quick and LASTS.",4
7194,This probably of the best insectacides I have used . I have an ingredient for fast knockdown and an ingredient for a powerful lasting residual .,4
7199,"White flower on one off in package, all a little tight, nothing a little glue won't do. Love em.",4
7200,They're very pretty I didn't give five stars because the flowers are falling,4
7201,These are lovely!! The only problem is that you have to be kind of careful with the flowers because they fall off easily.,4
7202,This are very cute and fun. My Daughter likes them,4
7203,Super cute roses did rip off easy if you aren't careful. But good product,4
7207,Does what it says! The scent is too strong but I got used to it.,4
7212,"Not as lemony as expected,but great lather,gentle soap.",4
7215,Another HS review. While this is not a cure it certainly helps!  It seems really expensive but the soap lasts forever!,4
7236,Easy to work with not too runny is what i like,4
7237,Wonderful powder. The two pinks look almost identical but still a great buy. Very comparable to higher end brands if not better.,4
7247,works as stated. but wish i would have gotten one at the store so i could buy replacement parts easier,4
7250,Doesn't work well on significant calluses but works well for maintenance once those are removed with a manual file,4
7257,"I like it, I use it along with my callus remover and I now have smooth skin.",4
7259,"My bridesmaid disclosed this information, we both retrieved benefits.",4
7269,I found it very easy to use as long as you read this instructions.  Extra care needed to not keep it on one spot too long.,4
7270,"works great, make sure you use it right out of the shower for best results, and remember not to leave it on your skin too long.",4
7274,Works great took off dead skin fast. You need to go over area several times,4
7276,My husband have very tough feet.  This works better than one we paid much more for.,4
7277,I have used in the tub. It works as expected.,4
7279,A little heavy but works very well.  My heels were very smooth after using!,4
7285,"Works great for the price!  Charger is a bit weak,  must charge before using.",4
7295,I like it. It really works takes the dead skin off,4
7306,Easy to use and recharge.  Gentle yet leaves skin soft and smooth.  I love the replaceable head. I would definitely recommend it,4
7307,"It is ok, but I still think a file works better",4
7308,Works really good. I thought it wasn't going to work but I was extremely happy with it.,4
7317,Great tool to have for your feet. It did not try in on wet feet but on try it got the job done very well,4
7320,Works ok. You have to find a balance on how hard you can push and it still spin.,4
7323,Does a fair job. The trick is to use it frequently,4
7326,Item arrived on time as promised.  Works well on the calluses around my heels.,4
7338,"Seems to be doing the job so far. Hope it holds up for awhile, at least long enough to justify the purchase.",4
7342,"Works well. Not as powerful as other callus removers.  so takes time and multiple uses to get desired results, but over all happy with it.",4
7357,The pearls fell out I had to re-glue them. But I love it,4
7360,Loved the bag. my husband is very happy with it. It can j=hold his literacy for Church,4
7369,"smells great and hold awesome, i wish it wasn't matt finish.",4
7373,I absolutely love the patterns and I think I can make it work even though it's a little bit short to fit my nails completely,4
7375,Does not come with the pink stamp but the templates are cute,4
7376,"It was a little bend from the sides, but whatever ..",4
7383,"I love it, its so small and really cute.",4
7384,It broke the first time I tried to put it on.,4
7402,Great product for its size. I like the nail clipper and the nail file especially.,4
7405,"Granddaughter loves it, says cool nail clipper, good buy.",4
7413,Not top quality (not expensive either) but great for travel and occasional use.,4
7418,very cute and compact. I definitely will be bringing it with me during my travels!,4
7422,It's so cute and I'm excited to use it but how do you close the nail clipper? Haha thanks!,4
7430,beautiful set . excellent for travel. the nail clippers are a bit small but is a great set for travel,4
7461,Good quality.  Good price.  Arrived quickly.  Easy to handle during use. Like that it is dual-sided - coarse and regular.,4
7462,"I used this foot file along with the callus remover, and the results were fantastic. My feet are beautiful again.",4
7488,Only thing is that it's a heavy piece but very beautiful,4
7491,sparkly hairband. Its beautiful but its little tight for my 6 years old girl,4
7516,"Nice pieces great quality, delivery prompt. Would like a mini case for it though... I will find one.",4
7521,The plates are good but the stamper doesn't work very well.,4
7523,They are really great! Buy they are a little to big!,4
7552,This item was smaller than I expected it to be but it still does the job. Shipping was fast too,4
7556,"It came on time , but they are small, but good",4
7563,the chain was to short to wear with. it really does not tell you the size. I put it on a different chain,4
7565,"It's super cute, but the chain broke. Not a problem, I just replaced the chain. The pendant is lovely.",4
7570,"Cute, love the 16 inch chain,  as pictured and arrived early in the delivery window given.",4
7581,Does it exactly the way its shown on TV works great,4
7582,"Does the job! No instructions included, so watch videos online for the creaclip.",4
7585,"worked good for my husbands haircut, but not for mine",4
7586,Product was as described and saved me a trip to the store.,4
7591,"It slides right out of my hair but not the fault of the product, I just have really soft, fine hair.",4
7595,i love the product.now i can do layer cut of my own .its really good...it reached me early .,4
7601,"Only problem is having to be very careful putting on, or it will turn white.",4
7606,The delivery was late but the product is good. It matches my skin tone and Iam happy with it.,4
7609,Solid product for the price! Very basic but you can apply however you need to get the look you want.,4
7615,It's soft and the shimmer is great but it came broken so I was kind of disappointed,4
7620,It's a good little highlighter for the price. Size is convenient enough to take with you in your purse or small makeup bag.,4
7623,"Although shipping took about a month, I am satisfied with this product. It applies very easily and it gives off an amazing sparkly glow!",4
7625,not a lot of product - but a great price. A-,4
7629,Its TINY. Yet it is a beautiful color and shimmer.,4
7632,"It's a bit oily, buy looks nice and a great price compared to similar items",4
7634,I would love it if it weren't so small! It's a great product and perfect for the base of your highlight!,4
7639,LOVE IT ! Gives me the best highlight ever ! It's a little small but so worth it !,4
7641,"You definitely have to use this product lightly don't press too hard when you use it. Otherwise very nice, cute and a little pinkish tone!",4
7642,A beautiful glow stick! Provides a nice highlight that I use on my cheekbones and I do get compliments :),4
7643,"Beautiful, but doesn't stay put as well as I'd like. I keep it in my purse to reapply as needed.",4
7646,Beautiful highlighter... but it's not really waterproof. Will buy it again.,4
7647,It's not really waterproof but has a nice lasting power.,4
7649,"It is very nice, just expected a little darker. It would look great on tan or dark  a complected person.",4
7658,Nice highlighter. It's cheap but it's good.,4
7659,Sponges are very soft. Perfect for blending. They do expand when wet just a bit. Cleaner works great too.,4
7662,Four stars because thought they'd be bigger .overall there okay . I still need to try them out . So I'll update in a few .,4
7666,One of the pieces wasn't entirely glues on and broke off when I was applying makeup to it. But everything else was fine,4
7668,"Great, but I was expecting for a circular motion on the brush part not just a vibration mode",4
7678,I thought I was ordering feathers but I got synthetic hair with the chevron pattern on it. I actually liked this better than real feathers.,4
7691,I would like to now where can I order the vacuum treatment heads. Love the product. But can't use it!,4
7693,"Great portable device for the money. Suction and power are mediocre, but great for weekly treatment.",4
7695,It works fairly well but the tips could be a better quality,4
7696,"The product is not bad,but the plastic head is not too strong",4
7698,The directions are not as clear as they should be.,4
7705,"Not exactly what I expected, but they are adequate for scrubbing makeup off before bed.",4
7710,Not like buff-puffs but will do...they don't lather up as much as the buff-puffs...,4
7717,Great brush! So much better than what I had before!!!,4
7723,"I don't care too much for the window , but the comfortability of the drake when fastening is perfect.",4
7729,"Chuck slips, but it's an ok grinder for nails.",4
7740,"So far it seems to work okay,some pieces better than others.",4
7755,Very easy to clip in. Shipped and arrived on time.,4
7762,"These are soft, adorable, and good quality! And after I figured out that the hair clips are reversable, they were extremely easy and secure!",4
7788,only downside is its kind of heavy for a belly button ring,4
7791,I do not like how it is all one piece. But other than that its super cute,4
7811,I very much like how it makes my skin FEEL but I am not such a fan of the scent/smell.....unfortunately its a deal breaker for me.,4
7818,"Nice size and delicious smelling. A little difficult to spread on skin, not super creamy, nice as hand cream.",4
7829,I really love this product! My only complaint is it's price for the size.,4
7849,Good product for cracked fingers and dry skin.  Best when used at bedtime since product leaves an initial film before it is absorbed into the skin.,4
7859,Great product! Great price! I am happy with this seller. I receive my order in a timely manner. Would recommend buying from this seller.,4
7868,Not as bubbly or foamy as expected. Smell was great though,4
7871,"Smaller than expected.  They do smell great. Downside, they dissolve super fast.  Do what they are supposed to do.",4
7872,Great but there was powder on the rest of our order - just messy but they are great.,4
7884,"I liked these bath bombs, the smell was too perfumey for me but I still found them worth what I spent.",4
7886,"Really good product for the price, came just as it said and smells good.",4
7908,"Got this for my friend for a Christmas gift, amazing gift.",4
7913,Not that big  but they smell amazing.  I will definitely buy again. And again. And again,4
7916,like the function but i didn't got the same colour what i order. even  some more 0f others.  i mean 7.,4
7919,These are pretty nice. I did have a ball fall out of the roller but overall I'm satisfied.,4
7928,good for the price..needed to trim and cut away a bit of heaviness..,4
7930,Looked strange on the wife but nothing wrong with the wig,4
7935,Have been using alligator clips for years and this was a good looking ones too.,4
7940,Very nice product.  The case is very pretty and durable!,4
7958,Simple novelty item.  Very slow to arrive. As advertised in all other respects.,4

7968,This pillow is good quality and the perfect gift for emoji lovers.,4
7971,It's not as big as I anticipated but it looks exactly the same in person. The quality is good.,4
7973,I thought it would be bigger but it's adorable. I added a comparison to show the size.,4
7978,"Took a LONG time to get here, but it's cute.",4
8003,"Works well :) Nice scent, non greasy feel. Would definitely buy again.",4
8007,"I haven't gotten a rash from this, I always break out with sunscreen. So, I'm excited",4
8017,"Time will tell how long these last, so will revisit review later, but like the colors and if they hold up, will definitely reorder!",4
8018,"I love these.  Cheap. Last a few months, and cheap enough to toss when they get old or unsanitary.",4
8027,"DO NOT let the price fool you. It gave me some relief, it helped me so what.",4
8028,Absolutely Beautiful. A little difficult keeping it on my head.  Longer hair or an up do would have no Problem.,4
8029,Beautiful crown worth the money. Looks just like in the picture. Only one problem it came broken.,4
8031,"Very good value. ""Blonde"" pins are actually a copper or rose gold color.",4
8033,I wish they were a little stiffer but for the price they seem to work well in my daughters hair for ballet.,4
8040,"Excellent value, just wish the tips were rubberized like the ones sold in stores",4
8044,These work just as well as the brand name ones that I keep losing! Great buy.,4
8050,It is not like what I thought but it's good,4
8053,"Sticky and a little hard to use, but I really like the color it leaves.",4
8060,Although this product and kinda hard to apply you get used to it later on and the color is really eye popping I love it!,4
8061,"Nice! I really like it, but unfortunately, it is a bit messy when applying. But other than that, it is great!",4
8072,easy to apply but it a pain when it gets on the cracks of the lip. and gets on teeth when I smile,4
8073,this is good for party favors for little girls and would be a hit...this brand peels off nicely,4
8082,I love the color super cute. Does make your lips dry though.,4
8083,i really liked this product although it looked darker than i expected,4
8084,"interesting! this color is a much darker pink than expected, but it is a pretty pink toned stain.",4
8107,Very Cute.  It's serviced it's purpose well.  I use this for wax melts.,4
8116,My favorite but this bottle smell does not seem to last to long?,4
8129,my wife likes it. Worked as expected. The only negative is the long shipping time (all the way from Korea).,4
8130,"First purchased this in Korea.  Great, soothing lotion.  Absorbs quickly.  Nice scent.",4
8131,"I mean, it works, but it's not really anything special.",4
8146,I used it for long time and I like it.,4
8156,"The smell is a little to much for my liking - since I cant return it Ill have to deal with it, hopefully the product works out .",4
8161,Nice basic cleanser. No bad results. Not brightening.,4
8165,"Its very light and smells very good, I use it as a morning cleanser.",4
8178,This is good product. Very fresh and clean wash up. I recommend it,4
8181,"This work just like a regular clenser; however, it is a little too dry after.",4
8183,Really nice on the skin but it does dry out my skin after I wash the cleanser off,4
8188,"Not the biggest fan of the smell, but great moisturizer for combo skin. It feels a bit heavy but does a great job.",4
8191,My skin was very dry in winter then I tried to use it. It's just a little sticky but still good for moisturizing,4
8193,Great green tea scent and very moisturizing.  If I use too much my skin doesn't like it.  A little goes a long way.,4
8198,"Sister like this product, hope that the seller shipped a clean product, do not put so dirty packaging to us. Thank you!",4
8199,"To buy a friend, she said great Hope to continue to maintain good quality and price. Thank you!",4
8209,"I love how gentle it is, and my skin doesn't feel as oily as it normally does.",4
8217,Great cleanser - strong perfume but does a great job.  I have very sensitive skin and this is gentle.,4
8232,all it does is absorbed really well and doesn't leave face oily.,4
8238,A nice light lotion for summer.  The fragrance is not at all heavy and smells fresh.  Leaves my face soft with no irritation.,4
8240,"This is nice, light product and it feels good on the skin",4
8250,Most work really well however I have had one that keeps leaking,4
8252,These are well made and work well.  I use them to apply valve oil to the valves on my horns and slides.,4
8266,I was expecting more of a spray from the bottle rather than a squirt but good product,4
8275,Definitely a nice facial mask. It helped with my facial break outs and with clearing up my face in general.,4
8288,The apple cider vinegar was leaking a bit. Otherwise great kit.,4
8304,"Works great ,wife and daughter love it. One thing is it is very hard for one person operation",4
8305,Fast delivery works well with hair as long in very small section. If larger will get stuck and burn hair.,4
8313,Hair sometimes gets stuck but I really liked the product. It gives really nice curls and it's quick and easy to use.,4
8317,Great idea and product! Quick shipping! Hair sometimes get caught though.,4
8354,C is for cookie that's good enough for me!,4
8356,"Customers love it and I enjoy it as well, quality on the inside looks as is coming off but overall great purchase",4
8358,The neck threads was comin off....the neck adjustment is not really hold that well...but clients like the see through cape,4
8364,"Love the wig. It just needs more reinforcement (additional combs needed in the back, and change the position of the front combs.",4
8365,Definitely a lot of hair but it's good quality synthetic hair.,4
8367,It's a fantastic product ! Natural  looking if styled right !,4
8368,Great wig for the money I spent on this item!,4
8370,Supper nice lots of hair but it look like it will get Tangled and it's really nice the quality of the hair looks real recommend the brand,4

8397,I only used it a few times but so far it goes on smooth and my skin feels soft.,4
8399,It's too early to tell if it really helps with stretch marks but the product itself is nice.  A nice smooth cream with a light smell,4
8400,it seems to be working on my strech marks so far. hope it keeps working as i lose the weight.,4
8422,"Works ok, not as good as Smartlash which I have used in the past!!",4
8424,I've been using for about 3 weeks and I see a slight difference.,4
8429,Like the compact size and same amount of product as others that are similar. Too soon to judge efficacy.,4
8435,I used it for about 6 weeks and saw absolutely no change in my lashes.,4
8455,Seems to be working some... but I am terrible at remembering to apply as needed...,4
8484,I can see it working.  It's not a miracle product but it works.,4
8486,Pretty good results it stings my eye at times but will get back with you about the eyelashe growth,4
8491,"Don't see a great change yet, but my lashes are slowly growing",4
8495,I feel like my lashes has grown after 2 weeks of use. Also it seem healthier for my extremely curly lashes.,4
8503,It burns just a bit after applying and then I feel nothing. My lashes seem to be growing back in and are visible again.,4
8508,I felt like my mascara would not stay on very well.,4
8511,So far so good. This application  is not messy at all. Its a smooth process. I'll  update this  review  after a month of use,4
8513,"This product works, although I would caution users that if you blink too soon after applying it stings your eyes.",4
8526,"I really have used it only a few weeks, but I think that I can tell growth.  It is too early to make an educated review.",4
8534,I'm starting to see a little bit of results in 3 days so far!,4
8565,"I'm very happy with the results of this growth serum. My lashes are longer, fuller, and is easy to use",4
8566,I like the quality but too early to tell if it works or not. Good customer service and fast delivery,4
8567,I use the serum every other day and I have noticed an improvement in the length of my eyelashes.,4
8570,I really like this looking forward to seeing results...product received at reduced rate,4
8575,"Great quality! Very soft and very real looking and matches perfectly, BUT they are very thin and I recommend ordering 2 or 3 packs.",4
8576,Excellent color match.  Great quality.  However I would advise buying 2 packages instead of one. One make the hair look stringy and will need trimming.,4
8589,Not bad but not as nice as the ones I've got from Sally's beauty . They feel better after you do a deep contioner on them .,4
8592,Excellent quality and easy to use. Will buy again.,4
8598,Good extensions for the price. They were pretty think a d feel like horse hair tho ...,4
8609,Good length and color. Great item for the pricing.,4
8611,Some of the hooks were falling off but it was an easy fix,4
8612,"Adhesive was entirely satisfactory. Unlike the Dore brand, it had a brush attached to the lid. It was also considerably cheaper.",4
8619,Will hold just about anything you can think of only thing is my skin had a bad reaction to it.,4
8620,"Difficult to get the hang of application, but easy to use",4
8628,"It worked well, you definitely need the remover, hard to get off skin with out it",4
8644,Hole clogs a bit with liquid soap (Dr Bronners),4
8648,"Good material, cleans easily. A bit heavy and bulky. If you're typically a size medium, I'd order a small.",4
8656,"Not a bad product, just difficult for me to use.",4
8662,"Good, just not as long as those they replaced and not as tightly braided",4
8667,"ordered for my daughter. Sizes are asian based, read here ""runs really small"". Pretty",4
8673,"Not quality fabric, but fine considering the price of the item",4
8690,This is a great in expensive eyebrow brush! It is not as hard as I wish it was but it does work well and does not shed.,4
8698,wish this smelled a little more pepperminty it is a bit weak though lathers beautifully like all their soaps,4
8709,Smells great! Bought as a gift however kept opening like the sticker keeping it close was warn off.,4
8727,Great product. Very potent and the label is easy to understand. The only down side was my dropper was broken when I opened the box.,4
8732,"Great gluten free cookies, however they are quite pricey for the amount in each package.",4
8760,Great for 5ml essential bottles.  I carry it every day.,4
8772,"It works great under the eyes , use twice a week,",4
8787,"its way better then that white guard, and the word Premium Guard is an understatement",4
8791,I  like my lookatool case for my Samsung galaxy s4.,4
8796,"They have these masks in all the shops in Japan. The cost would be considerably less than a ruined blouse, sweater or dress.",4
8801,I like the trial pack because it gives many options for different parts of the face.,4
8803,good way to keep yourself practicing the smiling. will use it and see .,4
8806,Great. Fits Tight . Hurts A Lil When First Put On . But In All Its Great,4
8815,"I had three break in the first day, I'm not really sure how, just cheap I guess...they almost look real but look fake also",4
8816,Sometimes gets stuck in the open position. But overall good!,4
8828,There were 2 with the same color buy other wise an awesome product,4
8833,Not super sturdy but work awesome if you're gentle.,4
8836,"came earlier than it said, but it's still a good buy if you're thinking about getting a piercing with a hoop",4
8842,"They are larger than I anticipated, but still cute.",4
8845,I bought this as per my daughter's request for her bohemian-themed slumber party. They look so fake but at the same time funny.,4
8866,Fast delivery.  Bottles are tiny but polish has worn well.  Takes longer to cure - 2-3 cycles under LED lamp,4
8867,"The blues are vey transparent. If u layer them over a black or white, they look nice.",4
8872,"These are very nice polishes for the price! My favorite is the gold glitter, but all the colors are great too!",4
8882,Colors not as identical as the picture. Overall ok.,4
8888,"Only lasts a week, but for the price and the shine i give it a 4 star.",4
8896,"The black and white speckled is a waste, but the other colors are nice.",4
8901,Nice colors. Easy to use. The glitter polish probably should be used over a color.,4
8902,"Great quality, just not the vibrant colors I would like.",4
8904,"Good for starers, make sure to fully cure each layer and paint on thin layers!",4
8923,This product is new to me and I thought I would give it a try!  I am loving it!  I would def recommend!,4

8930,This product is non-greasy and odor free. Hoping for some results soon.,4
8937,"not sure on the results yet, i will keep using it",4
8954,Works perfect but the color in person is different than the picture.,4
8974,Works as expected. Does have super long cord that is always in the way.,4
8982,Works well.  Is larger than I thought but not a problem.  It fits in a travel bag but it is too large for a purse.,4
8993,It didn't work as well as I thought it would.,4
9003,I am very pleased with the quality of the file and case. I especially like that the case stays together.,4
9010,Looks just like the picture. Great quality. Catches on clothes a lot though and longer than my pants.,4
9019,Very comfortable. Don't even seem like you have it on.,4
9021,nice but it pinches a little bit to keep it in place.,4
9038,"This is a really cute, fun necklace. It's lightweight and looks great on.",4

9067,"So good for the price, but of course it looks cheap.",4
9072,Very light & feminie with a touch of elegance to your summer wardrobe.,4
9087,"These are nice bottles to mix essential oil cleaning products, except the spray trigger is not optimal. Hard to hold and have a continuous spray pattern",4
9088,"One of the spray bottles doesn't spray, so I was disappointed in that, but they're very cute.",4
9089,"A bit hard to hold on too, but they do the job.  I'm using then with cooking oil to save calories.",4
9093,"Great looking and functioning bottles.  I had one bottle arrive with a broken spray nozzle, and the company quickly replaced the nozzle.",4
9098,"Great spray bottles... I only wish the liquid came out a little stronger.  It sprays out a light, fuzzy mist.",4
9099,"These are very nice. Sprayer works well so far, and has a nice spray.",4
9115,I needed to lose weight ASAP for a special event and these wraps were perfect I'm on my second box and I'm still seeing fast results !,4
9118,The product immediately toned my abdomen after three applications. I would definitely recommend this I talked to anyone trying to reduce inches and tone the abdomen.,4
9120,"Comfortable, easy to put on, stays on the entire time. Used one time. Haven't seen any results as of yet.",4
9121,I just received this product and have used it twice. I see a bit of a difference and it does make your skin fill smooth after application!,4

9128,"I was skeptical at first, but these really seem to work!  My tummy area seems to be flatter and more toned after 3 uses!",4

9133,Very easy to use and stayes on easy .. Ur able to work with it on and has a warm sensation. When it's working. Loved it..,4
9134,Seems like they are working. Stomach area seems tighter. Hopefully will notice more in the next couple of applications.,4
9146,Should be used a few times depending on desired results. Of course eat healthy drink plenty of water. Follow the instructions.,4
9148,Doesn't feel like it has any scrubbing effect and burns red spots,4
9149,Like this mask but I like my homemade one better.,4
9159,I bought this for a friend and she loved it. It's exactly as pictured and is really cute.,4
9169,I wore these for halloween and they arrived about 2 weeks before the actual date (: very pleased,4

9183,"Improvement visible in a Week, wrinkles on my neck are reduced and neck is firmer. I recommend.",4
9193,I bought this as a gift and she liked it.,4
9194,Most are great for the price. Have problems with the ends staying in the larger black with red stamper. They like to fall out.,4

9216,Not happy !! You should not be scaling this to people!,4
9218,I love them but I didn't get the color I wanted. And they came 3 weeks early.,4
9219,"Two of each brush except for foundation, they smell weird, plus side they came early and there good quality brushes, good purchase ",4
9220,Overall the makeup brushes are as expected for the price paid.,4
9237,it definitely lightened up the sun spot i had on my forehead!!,4
9257,This product is needed to remove the for with ease. Didn't realize it was so small but great for travel in my makeup kit,4
9271,The most affordable roller bottles I've found. Took off one star because 1 cap could not be screwed on because of a defect.,4
9287,Cute bottles! Ordered 2 sets and was not disappointed!,4
9289,I wore your product to bed.  I had no problems sleeping with the applicator on.  I woke up feeling good.  And my skin looked amazing.,4
9297,"they somewhat worked, i religiously followed instructions and it didn't seem to do much. love the product though.",4

9372,"i love it! i have medium deep skin and this is nice. not all the colors show, but the powders are beautiful.",4

9384,Was a gift and the set arrived fast and slightly damaged,4
9392,Great contour kit ! It is easy to apply and blend. It leaves your skin looking flawless. Product came fast and in good condition,4
9393,"I think they're nice, not as stiff as id like.",4
9394,made in china......~BTWChina is graet! I love it!,4
9397,Love these stamps. I have only used them on my own nails and they have worked perfect for me! Images are etched in wonderfully.,4
